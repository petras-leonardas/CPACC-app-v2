    question: 'What is the purpose of theoretical models of disability?',
    options: [
      'They offer different frameworks for understanding disability, each with strengths and limitations, and none fully comprehensive.',
      'They define one universally correct explanation of disability that applies across all contexts.',
      'They prescribe a single best model that organizations should use when designing accessibility programs.',
      'They classify disabilities into medical categories to determine appropriate treatment plans.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK description that models provide perspectives, are not fully complete, and are often used in combination. The other options incorrectly claim universal correctness, exclusive use of one model, or a narrow medical-classification purpose.',

  {
    id: '102',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'How does the medical model view disability?',
    options: [
      'It frames disability as a problem within the individual caused by disease or injury that requires medical treatment or cure.',
      'It views disability as primarily the result of social and environmental barriers rather than individual impairment.',
      'It treats disability as a cultural identity defined by group membership and shared experiences.',
      'It interprets disability mainly through its economic impact on productivity and employment.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This aligns with the medical model, which locates disability in the individual and focuses on treatment or cure. The other options describe the social model, cultural identity model, and economic model, which are based on different assumptions.',
    subject: 'Medical model'
  },
  {
    id: '103',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'What is a primary strength of the medical model?',
    options: [
      'It can address the biological causes of disability and provide medical treatments or management strategies when needed.',
      'It ensures that disability is understood entirely as a product of environmental barriers rather than bodily conditions.',
      'It prioritizes cultural identity and community belonging as the main lens for understanding disability.',
      'It focuses on economic productivity to determine the level of disability support required.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This matches the BoK description that the medical model\'s strength is its ability to address underlying biological conditions. The other options describe the social model, cultural affiliation model, and economic model, which reflect different purposes and assumptions.',
    subject: 'Medical model'
  },
  {
    id: '104',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'What is a major weakness of the medical model?',
    options: [
      'It treats disability as an individual problem and often overlooks how societal and environmental barriers contribute to disabling conditions.',
      'It assumes disability results only from social attitudes and excludes any consideration of medical needs.',
      'It overemphasizes personal identity and group culture as the primary explanation for disability.',
      'It fails to recognize economic impacts and therefore avoids discussions of support or accommodations.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK\'s description that the medical model centers disability within the individual and neglects environmental and sociopolitical factors. The other options describe weaknesses of the social model, cultural affiliation model, and economic model rather than the medical model.',
    subject: 'Medical model'
  },
  {
    id: '105',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'What does the social model of disability emphasize?',
    options: [
      'It explains disability as the result of societal and environmental barriers rather than the person\'s impairment, highlighting the need to remove barriers for full participation.',
      'It views disability as a medical condition that must be treated or cured through clinical intervention.',
      'It defines disability primarily by an individual\'s economic productivity and work limitations.',
      'It bases disability identity on cultural affiliation and belonging to a specific community.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This matches the BoK explanation that disability is created by social and environmental barriers, not the impairment itself. The other options describe the medical, economic, and cultural affiliation models, which emphasize different underlying assumptions.',
    subject: 'Social model'
  },
  {
    id: '106',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'What is a major strength of the social model?',
    options: [
      'It shows that societal and environmental barriers—not impairments—create disability and that removing those barriers can significantly improve participation.',
      'It provides detailed medical explanations for impairments and guides clinical treatment approaches.',
      'It defines disability mainly by its economic impact on productivity and financial support systems.',
      'It centers disability identity entirely on cultural belonging and group affiliation.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The social model\'s strength is its emphasis that barriers are not inevitable and can be changed through inclusive design and social action. The other options describe the medical, economic, and cultural affiliation models, which differ in focus and underlying assumptions.',
    subject: 'Social model'
  },
  {
    id: '107',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'What is a critique of the social model?',
    options: [
      'It can downplay the embodied and medical aspects of disability and may create political tension when advocating for social change.',
      'It overlooks societal barriers by focusing solely on medical treatment and cure.',
      'It assumes disability is defined entirely by economic productivity and eligibility for benefits.',
      'It reduces disability to cultural identity and group membership without considering broader contexts.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option aligns with the BoK, which notes that the social model may underemphasize bodily realities and can lead to political conflict. The other statements reflect critiques of the medical, economic, and cultural affiliation models, not the social model.',
    subject: 'Social model'
  },
  {
    id: '108',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'Which three factors does the biopsychosocial model consider?',
    options: [
      'It incorporates biological, psychological, and social factors to explain disability in a holistic way.',
      'It focuses solely on biological conditions and excludes psychological or social influences.',
      'It emphasizes cultural identity, group belonging, and social attitudes as the primary determinants of disability.',
      'It limits disability assessment to economic productivity and eligibility for state benefits.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The biopsychosocial model explicitly integrates medical, psychological, and social dimensions of disability. The other options describe the medical model, cultural affiliation model, and economic model, none of which reflect this integrated approach.',
    subject: 'Biopsychosocial model'
  },
  {
    id: '109',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'How is the biopsychosocial model useful?',
    options: [
      'It supports coordinated interventions that address both medical and social factors, making it especially effective in rehabilitation contexts.',
      'It eliminates the need for medical input by focusing solely on environmental barriers.',
      'It provides a single standardized definition of disability based only on economic productivity.',
      'It replaces the need for interdisciplinary teams by centering treatment entirely on psychological factors.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The biopsychosocial model\'s strength lies in integrating biological, psychological, and social elements to guide comprehensive, team-based interventions. The other statements misrepresent the model by removing medical factors, focusing only on economics, or ignoring its interdisciplinary approach.',
    subject: 'Biopsychosocial model'
  },
  {
    id: '110',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'What is a concern regarding the biopsychosocial model and the ICF?',
    options: [
      'Critics argue it may downplay medical needs and is complex to implement, creating challenges for consistent application.',
      'It dismisses the role of social barriers entirely and treats disability solely as a biological condition.',
      'It removes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration by prioritizing economic assessments.',
      'It assumes disability is primarily a cultural identity and overlooks functional or medical factors.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects concerns noted in the BoK: that the ICF\'s integration of social and medical factors may underemphasize medical needs and is difficult to apply due to its complexity. The other statements describe issues relevant to the medical, economic, or cultural affiliation models, not the biopsychosocial model.',
