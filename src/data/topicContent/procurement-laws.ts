  introduction: [
    'Domain-specific accessibility laws focus on particular technologies, industries, or activities where barriers have been especially persistent or where access is essential for participation in modern life. Rather than applying broadly across society, these laws target sectors such as communications, transportation, media, digital identity, and public procurement. Their purpose is to ensure that accessibility is built into systems that people rely on daily for information, mobility, work, safety, and civic participation.',
    'These laws often emerge where general anti-discrimination frameworks are not specific enough to address technical complexity or rapidly changing technologies. By setting targeted obligations, domain-specific laws clarify responsibilities, establish accessibility as a baseline requirement, and help ensure that innovation does not leave people with disabilities behind.'

      content: [
        'General disability rights laws establish equality and non-discrimination, but they often leave practical details open to interpretation. In complex sectors like telecommunications, aviation, or digital services, accessibility depends on technical standards, coordinated infrastructure, and industry-wide practices.',
        'Domain-specific laws address this gap by:',
        'Updating older accessibility requirements to reflect modern technologies',
        'Setting clear expectations for industries with high public impact',
        'Embedding accessibility into safety-critical and rights-critical systems',
        'Ensuring consistency across markets and service providers',
        'These laws often work alongside broader disability rights legislation, reinforcing accessibility as a core requirement rather than an optional feature.'
