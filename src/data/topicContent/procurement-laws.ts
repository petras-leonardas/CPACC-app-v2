    'Sometimes, general rules about fairness are not enough to cover the complicated gadgets and systems we use every day. Domain-specific laws are special rules that focus on one specific area of life, like how we travel, how we watch TV, or how we use our phones. These laws make sure that as technology moves forward, no one gets left behind.',
    'Think of these laws as a specialized toolkit. While a general law might say a building must be open to everyone, a domain-specific law gives the exact instructions for making sure a high-tech airplane or a digital streaming service is ready for every user. These rules take the guesswork out of design and make accessibility a standard part of doing business.',

        'General rights laws tell us that everyone should be treated equally, but they do not always explain the technical "how-to" for complex things like satellites or computer networks. Domain-specific laws fill in those blanks. They provide a clear map for industries to follow so that safety and communication are guaranteed for everyone.',
        'These laws are important because they update old rules to fit modern technology. They also make sure that accessibility is treated as a "must-have" feature instead of an afterthought. By setting clear expectations, these laws help companies build better products from the very start.',

        'The <strong>Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act</strong> (or CVAA) is a major law from October 8, 2010, that brought U.S. communication rules into the modern age. It makes sure that as we move from old-fashioned landlines to internet calls and streaming video, people with disabilities have the same access to these tools as everyone else. This law ensures that the "latest and greatest" tech is also the most inclusive.',
        'In Europe, the <strong>Audiovisual Media Services Directive</strong> (or AVMSD) does something similar for television and online video. This directive is a set of guidelines that tells media companies in the European Union they need to keep getting better at offering things like captions and sign language. This means that more people can enjoy their favorite shows and stay informed during emergencies.',

        'The <strong>Air Carrier Access Act</strong> is a law from 1986 that makes it illegal for airlines to discriminate against people because of a disability. It was later supported by the <strong>Air Carrier Access Amendments Act of 2017</strong>, which helped make sure the rules kept up with how we travel today. These laws cover everything from getting help boarding a plane to making sure that wheelchairs are handled with care.',
        'Because of these rules, flying is treated as a right for everyone, not just a lucky break for some. Whether a person is flying on a U.S. airline or a foreign airline coming into a U.S. airport, these rules ensure that the journey is as smooth and dignified as possible for every traveler.',

        'The <strong>European Electronic Communications Code</strong> is a big set of rules that governs how phone and internet services work across Europe. One of its main jobs is making sure that people with disabilities can get help when they need it most. This code requires that emergency services be easy to reach for everyone, regardless of how they communicate.',
        'This law also ensures that things like contracts and service info are written in ways that people can actually read or hear. It recognizes that being able to call for help or talk to a friend is not just a luxury—it is a basic part of staying safe and staying connected to the community.',

Because we use these digital "keys" for things like online banking or signing government papers, this law requires them to be accessible. This ensures that everyone can prove who they are and get things done online without running into digital walls.',

        'Governments spend a lot of money on technology and services. Procurement laws are rules that say, "If you want the government to buy your product, it must be accessible." This is a powerful way to change the world because it encourages companies to design for everyone if they want to win big government contracts.',
        'The <strong>EU Public Procurement Directive</strong> is a set of rules that tells public offices across Europe they must think about "design for all" when they spend public money. By requiring accessibility in their shopping lists, they make it the standard for the entire market. This helps create a world where accessible products are everywhere, not just in special shops.',
        'In the United States, the <strong>Federal Acquisition Regulation</strong> (or FAR) does a similar job. It uses the power of the federal government\'s wallet to make sure that the digital tools used by government workers and the public meet high accessibility standards. This is often linked to <strong>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</strong>, which is a law from 1973 that requires federal technology to be usable by people with disabilities.',

By weaving these rules into the industries we use every day—like travel, TV, and phones—we make sure that everyone can join the party and contribute their talents to society.',
