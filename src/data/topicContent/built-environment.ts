    'Designing for the physical world is about more than just bricks and mortar. It is about making sure that every building, street, and bus is a place where everyone can move around safely and feel like they belong. When we design our world to be accessible, we are making sure that no one is left out of the party just because of how they move or see.',

      heading: 'The big picture of physical accessibility',
      content: 'Imagine trying to go to school, visit a doctor, or just meet a friend for coffee, but finding a giant set of stairs in your way. Accessibility in the built environment—which is a fancy way of saying all the physical spaces we build—is about removing those "keep out" signs. It is a core part of good planning, especially as our global population gets older and more of us experience changes in how our bodies work.',

    {
      heading: 'Accessibility and safety go hand-in-hand',
      content: 'Accessibility is not just about convenience; it is a life-saver. Think about emergency exits or fire alarms. If a building is designed without thinking about everyone, some people might be at a much higher risk during an emergency. Good design means that everyone, including people who use wheelchairs or those who cannot hear a siren, can get to safety quickly and independently.',

      heading: 'Universal design: The original physical framework',
      content: 'The seven principles of universal design actually started with physical buildings. The goal is to create spaces that "just work" for the widest range of people possible without needing to change them later. It is like building a house with a level entrance from the start. It is cheaper than adding a ramp later, and it helps everyone—from a traveler with heavy luggage to a parent pushing a stroller.',

      heading: 'Minimum standards versus best practice',
      content: [
        'Most countries have laws that set "minimum standards" for buildings. These are like the "C-minus" of design—it is the least you can do to avoid breaking the law. Often, these laws focus on <strong>reasonable accommodations</strong>, which are specific changes made for one person\'s needs.',
        'While these rules are important, they usually do not go far enough. <strong>Universal design</strong> aims for the "A-plus." It goes beyond the legal minimum to create spaces that are actually welcoming and comfortable for everyone to use, rather than just technically "legal."',

      heading: 'Where we focus our design energy',
      content: [
        'To make a world that works for everyone, we look at a few key areas:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li><strong>Getting in and out:</strong> This includes level entrances and doors that open automatically.</li><li><strong>Moving around inside:</strong> We need wide hallways, elevators that talk to you, and signs that are easy to read.</li><li><strong>The world outside:</strong> This covers sidewalks with curb cuts and public transit like buses and trains that everyone can board easily.</li><li><strong>Connecting to the big rules:</strong> Accessibility works best when it is a part of every government policy, from housing to how we plan our cities.</li></ul>',
        'When we design our physical world with diversity in mind, we aren\'t just helping a small group of people. We are building a stronger, more resilient society where every person has the freedom to move and participate.',
