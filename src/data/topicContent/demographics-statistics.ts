    'When we talk about disability demographics and statistics, we are really trying to understand the big picture of how many people live with disabilities and what their daily lives look like. This isn\'t just about memorizing giant numbers. Instead, it is about learning how to read data with a kind and careful eye so we can see the real people behind the percentages.',
    'Because every country and culture defines disability in its own way, the data can sometimes feel like a puzzle. In accessibility work, these numbers help us realize the scale of the world we are designing for. They remind us that disability isn\'t a rare or "extra" thing—it is a natural part of being human.',

        'We use disability statistics to plan for the future. Imagine trying to throw a party without knowing how many guests are coming or what they like to eat. You would probably end up with a lot of unhappy people! Data helps governments and organizations plan for things like buses, schools, and hospitals that actually work for the people living in their communities.',
        'When we look at the data, it also helps us realize that disability is very common. It challenges the idea that having a disability is an "exception" to the rule. Even if the data isn\'t perfect, it shines a light on gaps where people might be struggling to get a job or find a home, making sure they aren\'t invisible to the people in charge.',

      heading: 'How do we gather this information?',
      content: [
        'People collect disability data in lots of ways, like national censuses or health surveys. A census is a giant official count of every person living in a country. However, different surveys ask different questions. One might ask about a medical diagnosis, while another might ask if you have trouble climbing stairs.',
        'Because there isn\'t one single global definition of disability, it can be hard to compare two different countries. A person might be counted as "disabled" in one study but not in another just because the rules changed. This is why we always need to look at the "why" and "how" behind the numbers.',

        'Collecting data about people is complicated, and there are a few reasons why the numbers might not show the full reality.<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Many big surveys don\'t ask for enough detail about the specific types of disabilities people have or how severe they are.</li><li>The words we use for disability change depending on the language or the local laws, which makes it hard to compare data across borders.</li><li>Many people live with more than one disability at the same time, which doesn\'t always fit into a neat little box on a form.</li><li>Some people might not report their disability because they are afraid of being treated differently or because they don\'t have an official diagnosis.</li><li>Things like how much money someone has or where they live can change how their disability affects them, and numbers often miss that personal context.</li></ul>',

      content: [
        'When we look at the world as a whole, we see that disability is closely tied to how people live. On average, people with disabilities often face more health challenges and might not live as long. This usually isn\'t because of the disability itself, but because of "barriers" in the world around them.',
        'For example, if the only bus in town doesn\'t have a ramp, a person who uses a wheelchair might not be able to get to the doctor. This is a systemic failure, which is a fancy way of saying the system was built in a way that leaves people out. Our goal is to use data to find these broken parts of the system and fix them.',

        'Reliable data is a superpower for people who make laws. It helps them figure out how many people need support in the workplace or how many kids need extra help at school. When used correctly, statistics help us make decisions based on facts rather than guesses.',
        'However, if we use numbers without thinking about the people they represent, we risk making things worse. Using disability data responsibly means being honest about what we don\'t know and always remembering that every "data point" is a real person with a real life.',

This is roughly <strong>1 in 6</strong> people on the planet.</li><li>People with disabilities may die up to <strong>20 years earlier</strong> than people without them because of a lack of support and care.</li><li>People with disabilities have a <strong>two times higher risk</strong> of facing health issues like depression or diabetes because the world isn\'t always set up for their needs.</li><li>Finding a bus or train that is both easy to use and affordable is <strong>15 times harder</strong> for people with disabilities.</li></ul>',
