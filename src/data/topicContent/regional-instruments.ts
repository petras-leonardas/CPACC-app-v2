  introduction: [
    'Regional human rights instruments—such as charters, conventions, and protocols—play a crucial role in protecting and advancing the rights of people with disabilities. While global frameworks establish broad principles, regional instruments often reflect shared histories, legal traditions, and social realities. They can strengthen protections, fill gaps left by international law, and provide enforcement mechanisms that are closer and more accessible to individuals.',
    'Many regional instruments were created before the global disability rights treaty emerged. Even today, they remain highly relevant. Regional systems allow individuals and organizations to bring complaints before regional courts and commissions, creating accountability and practical pathways for enforcement. Together with global agreements, these instruments form a layered human rights framework that supports disability rights at international, regional, and national levels.'

      heading: 'Why Regional Instruments Matter',
      content: [
        'Regional human rights instruments serve several important functions. They often interpret human rights in ways that reflect regional priorities, such as economic development, social inclusion, or post-conflict realities. They can also move faster than global systems in responding to emerging issues or strengthening enforcement.',
        'Another critical role of regional instruments is access to justice. Many allow individuals or organizations to bring cases before regional human rights bodies, such as courts or commissions. These mechanisms can lead to binding judgments, policy changes, or increased pressure on governments to uphold rights.',
        'In disability rights, regional instruments have helped clarify non-discrimination, social participation, accessibility, and inclusion—sometimes even before these ideas were firmly established at the global level.'

      heading: 'The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Related European Instruments',
      content: [
        'Europe has a layered human rights system built over decades. The European Union adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights to bring clarity and consistency to rights protections across its Member States.',
        'The Charter draws on earlier European treaties, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Social Charter. Together, these instruments protect civil, political, economic, and social rights. While disability was not always explicitly named in earlier treaties, protections against discrimination apply broadly and have been used to address disability-related cases.',
        'The Charter became legally binding in 2009 and explicitly addresses disability in two important ways. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability and affirms the right of people with disabilities to independence, social and occupational integration, and participation in community life. This makes disability rights a core part of EU law and policy.'

      heading: 'The African Charter on Human and Peoples\' Rights and the African Disability Rights Protocol',
      content: [
        'The African Union adopted the African Charter on Human and Peoples\' Rights in 1981. The Charter recognizes a broad range of rights and emphasizes collective as well as individual responsibilities. Although disability is not explicitly named in its non-discrimination provisions, the Charter has been interpreted to protect people with disabilities under general equality principles.',
        'To strengthen disability-specific protections, the African Union later adopted the African Disability Rights Protocol. This protocol builds on global disability rights principles while addressing regional concerns, such as armed conflict, forced displacement, and harmful traditional practices that disproportionately affect people with disabilities.',
        'The protocol adds detailed obligations for states, including measures to combat stigma, violence, and harmful practices. Although it has faced delays in reaching full legal force, it represents a significant step toward regionally grounded disability rights protection in Africa.'

      heading: 'The Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities',
      content: [
        'In the Americas, the Organization of American States adopted a landmark disability rights treaty in 1999. This convention was the first binding regional instrument to explicitly prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities.',
        'Its primary goal is to prevent and eliminate discrimination and to promote full social integration. The convention addresses accessibility directly, calling on states to remove barriers in areas such as transportation, communication, housing, education, employment, and public services.',
        'By requiring both the elimination of existing barriers and the design of new environments that are accessible, the convention links non-discrimination with practical accessibility measures. It also allows disability rights issues to be raised before regional human rights bodies, strengthening enforcement.'

      heading: 'Regional Instruments in the Broader Human Rights Framework',
      content: [
        'Regional human rights instruments do not replace global agreements—they complement them. They reinforce universal principles while tailoring protections to regional contexts. In some cases, they provide stronger monitoring, clearer obligations, or more accessible enforcement mechanisms.',
        'For disability rights, this layered approach is especially important. Barriers are often shaped by local infrastructure, cultural practices, and regional economic conditions. Regional instruments help ensure that human rights protections are not abstract, but responsive to real-world conditions.',
        'Together, regional and global frameworks affirm that disability rights are human rights—and that accessibility, equality, and inclusion must be protected at every level of governance.'
