  introduction: [
    'Regional human rights instruments—such as charters, conventions, and protocols—play a crucial role in protecting and advancing the rights of people with disabilities. While global frameworks establish broad principles, regional instruments often reflect shared histories, legal traditions, and social realities. They can strengthen protections, fill gaps left by international law, and provide enforcement mechanisms that are closer and more accessible to individuals.',
    'Many regional instruments were created before the global disability rights treaty emerged. Even today, they remain highly relevant. Regional systems allow individuals and organizations to bring complaints before regional courts and commissions, creating accountability and practical pathways for enforcement. Together with global agreements, these instruments form a layered human rights framework that supports disability rights at international, regional, and national levels.'

      heading: 'Why regional instruments matter?',
      content: [
        'Regional human rights instruments serve several important functions. They often interpret human rights in ways that reflect regional priorities, such as economic development, social inclusion, or post-conflict realities. They can also move faster than global systems in responding to emerging issues or strengthening enforcement.',
        'Another critical role of regional instruments is access to justice. Many allow individuals or organizations to bring cases before regional human rights bodies, such as courts or commissions. These mechanisms can lead to binding judgments, policy changes, or increased pressure on governments to uphold rights.',
        'In disability rights, regional instruments have helped clarify non-discrimination, social participation, accessibility, and inclusion—sometimes even before these ideas were firmly established at the global level.'

          heading: 'European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)',
          content: 'The European Convention on Human Rights is a foundational human rights treaty signed in 1950. All Council of Europe member states—nearly all countries in geographical Europe—are party to the convention. The ECHR establishes fundamental civil and political rights for everyone.<br/><br/>While the ECHR does not explicitly list people with disabilities among protected groups, disability is covered under "other status" in its non-discrimination provisions. This means protections against discrimination apply to people with disabilities.<br/><br/>An important feature of the ECHR is that individuals can bring cases directly to the European Court of Human Rights if they believe a state has violated their rights under the convention. This provides a concrete enforcement mechanism for human rights protections.'

          content: 'The European Social Charter was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1961 as a counterpart to the ECHR. While the ECHR focuses on civil and political rights, the ESC guarantees fundamental social and economic rights.<br/><br/>The ESC explicitly addresses disability rights. It grants the right of people with disabilities to independence, social integration, and participation in community life. This makes it one of the earlier international instruments to specifically recognize these rights for disabled people.'

          content: 'The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was adopted in 2000 to bring consistency and clarity to the rights established at different times and in different ways across EU Member States. It brings together the full range of civil, political, economic, and social rights for everyone living in the EU.<br/><br/>The Charter is based on five key sources:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>The fundamental rights and freedoms recognized by the European Convention on Human Rights</li><li>The constitutional traditions of EU Member States</li><li>The Council of Europe\'s Social Charter</li><li>The Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers</li><li>Other international conventions to which the EU or its Member States are parties</li></ul><br/>The Charter became legally binding on EU Member States when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force in December 2009. This means EU institutions and Member States must respect the rights and principles set out in the Charter when implementing EU law.'

          heading: 'Key disability rights provisions',
          content: 'The Charter explicitly addresses disability rights in two important articles:<br/><br/><strong>Article 21: Non-discrimination</strong><br/>Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, <strong>disability</strong>, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.<br/><br/><strong>Article 26: Integration of persons with disabilities</strong><br/>The Union recognizes and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community.<br/><br/>Together, these articles make disability rights a core part of EU law and policy, ensuring both non-discrimination and positive measures to support full participation.'

          content: 'The African Union adopted the African Charter on Human and Peoples\' Rights in 1981. The Charter recognizes a broad range of rights for all people and emphasizes both individual rights and collective responsibilities—a distinctive feature that reflects African legal and cultural traditions.<br/><br/>Although disability is not explicitly named in the Charter\'s non-discrimination provisions, its protections have been interpreted and applied to fight discrimination against people with disabilities and provide equal protection under the law. This demonstrates how general human rights frameworks can be used to advance disability rights even without explicit language.'

          heading: 'The African Disability Rights Protocol (ADRP)',
          content: 'To strengthen disability-specific protections, the African Union adopted the African Disability Rights Protocol in 2018. The ADRP builds on the global CRPD while addressing regional concerns that are particularly relevant to the African context.<br/><br/>The protocol provides more extensive and specific provisions in several key areas:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Armed conflicts and their impact on people with disabilities</li><li>Forced displacement and protection during humanitarian crises</li><li>Harmful traditional practices that disproportionately affect people with disabilities</li></ul><br/>These additions reflect realities that many African countries face, ensuring that disability rights protections are grounded in the specific challenges and contexts of the region.'

          heading: 'Addressing harmful practices',
          content: 'One area where the ADRP goes beyond the CRPD is in its treatment of harmful practices. While the CRPD addresses harmful practices broadly, the ADRP provides detailed provisions and explicitly names specific practices that affect people with disabilities in some African communities.<br/><br/><strong>Article 11(1) of the ADRP</strong> requires states to take appropriate measures and offer support to victims of harmful practices, including legal sanctions and advocacy campaigns. The article specifically mentions practices such as:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Witchcraft accusations and related violence</li><li>Abandonment and concealment of people with disabilities</li><li>Ritual killings</li><li>Association of disability with omens or supernatural causes</li></ul><br/>By naming these practices explicitly, the ADRP helps bring attention to specific forms of discrimination and violence that might otherwise remain hidden or unaddressed. This specificity makes it a powerful tool for advocacy and legal protection.'

          content: 'The African Disability Rights Protocol represents a significant step toward regionally grounded disability rights protection in Africa. However, it requires 15 ratifications to enter into full legal force. As of 2023, it had not yet reached this threshold, meaning its provisions are not yet legally binding across the continent.<br/><br/>Despite this delay, the protocol\'s adoption demonstrates regional commitment to disability rights and provides a framework that countries can adopt into national law even before formal ratification requirements are met.'

This convention predates the global CRPD by seven years, making it the first binding regional treaty that expressly prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities.<br/><br/>By addressing disability rights explicitly before the global framework emerged, the Inter-American Convention demonstrated regional leadership and helped shape thinking about how disability rights should be protected in international law.'

The convention recognizes that states must actively work to ensure people with disabilities can participate fully in all aspects of community life.'

          heading: 'Implementation approach',
          content: 'The convention takes a two-part approach to achieving accessibility. First, it requires states to eliminate architectural, transportation, and communication obstacles to the extent possible. This addresses existing barriers that prevent people with disabilities from accessing buildings, services, and information.<br/><br/>Second, the convention requires that new buildings, vehicles, and facilities be designed to facilitate transportation, communications, and access by persons with disabilities from the start. This forward-looking requirement helps prevent new barriers from being created.<br/><br/>By requiring both the elimination of existing barriers and accessible design for new developments, the convention links non-discrimination with practical accessibility measures. It also allows disability rights issues to be raised before regional human rights bodies, creating accountability and enforcement mechanisms.'

        'For disability rights, this layered approach is especially important. Barriers are often shaped by local infrastructure, cultural practices, and regional economic conditions. Regional instruments help ensure that human rights protections are not abstract, but responsive to real-world conditions.',
