  introduction: [
    'Disability can be understood in many different ways, depending on the lens you use. Theoretical models of disability are frameworks that help explain what disability is, where barriers come from, and what kinds of responses society tends to prioritize. No single model captures the full reality of disabled people\'s lives. Each one highlights certain aspects while leaving others in the background.',
    'In real-world accessibility work, these models shape decisions about design, policy, healthcare, education, employment, and technology. Understanding them makes it easier to recognize why some solutions focus on "fixing" individuals, while others focus on changing environments, systems, or attitudes. Most organizations and practitioners do not rely on a single model, but instead blend ideas—often combining medical, social, and practical approaches—to respond more effectively to complex human needs.'

      heading: 'Medical model',
      content: [
        'The medical model approaches disability as something that exists within an individual\'s body or mind. From this perspective, disability is primarily the result of injury, illness, or a health condition. The focus is on diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and, when possible, cure. Professionals such as doctors, therapists, and clinicians play a central role, and success is often measured by how closely a person can be brought toward typical physical or cognitive functioning.',
        'This model reflects an important reality: many people experience pain, fatigue, illness, or functional limitations that require medical care. Medication, surgery, therapy, and assistive devices can significantly improve quality of life. For many individuals, medical intervention is essential and non-negotiable.',
        'However, the medical model tends to frame disability as a personal problem rather than a shared societal responsibility. When disability is seen only as an individual deficit, barriers created by buildings, technologies, policies, or social attitudes can be overlooked. People may feel pressured to adapt themselves to environments that were never designed for them, rather than questioning why those environments are inaccessible in the first place. This can also lead to experiences of stigma, pity, or being treated as incapable beyond the specific impairment.'

    {
      heading: 'Social model',
      content: [
        'The social model shifts attention away from individual bodies and toward the world people live in. In this view, disability arises not from an impairment itself, but from barriers created by society. Stairs become disabling when there is no ramp or elevator. Printed text becomes disabling when alternative formats are unavailable. Attitudes, assumptions, and rigid systems can be just as limiting as physical obstacles.',
        'This model emphasizes that disability is something people encounter, not something they inherently "have." When environments are designed inclusively, many limitations disappear or are significantly reduced. As a result, the social model strongly aligns with accessibility, inclusive design, and human rights perspectives. It encourages changes to laws, policies, infrastructure, technologies, and cultural norms so that a wide range of people can participate fully.',
        'At the same time, the social model can underplay the lived, physical, and psychological realities of impairment. Pain, fatigue, sensory overload, or chronic illness do not disappear simply because barriers are removed. Additionally, its strong emphasis on social change can place disability advocacy in direct conflict with other political or economic priorities, sometimes leading to resistance or polarization.'

      heading: 'Biopsychosocial model',
      content: [
        'The biopsychosocial model attempts to bridge the gap between medical and social perspectives. It recognizes that disability is shaped by an interaction between biological factors (such as health conditions), psychological factors (such as emotions, coping strategies, and mental health), and social factors (such as relationships, work conditions, economic resources, and accessibility of environments).',
        'Rather than asking only "What is wrong with the body?" or "What barriers exist in society?", this model asks how all these elements combine in a specific person\'s life. For example, two people with the same diagnosis may have very different experiences depending on their support systems, mental well-being, financial stability, and environment.',
        'This integrated approach is especially useful in rehabilitation and support planning, where both medical needs and participation in daily life must be considered. However, the model can be complex and difficult to apply consistently. There is also concern that blending perspectives may unintentionally minimize medical needs or make responsibilities unclear if not handled carefully.'

      heading: 'Economic model',
      content: [
        'The economic model views disability primarily through the lens of work and productivity. Disability is defined by the extent to which a person\'s impairment affects their ability to participate in paid employment and contribute economically. This model often informs decisions about income support, benefits, insurance, and workplace accommodations.',
        'One strength of this approach is that it acknowledges the real financial impacts disability can have, both for individuals and for society. It can justify economic support, job accommodations, or policy interventions aimed at reducing disadvantage in employment contexts.',
        'At the same time, tying disability status to economic productivity can be deeply limiting. People who do not meet strict legal or administrative definitions may be denied support, even when they face significant barriers. It can also reinforce stigma by categorizing disabled people as dependents or burdens, rather than as full participants with diverse contributions beyond paid labor.'

      heading: 'Functional solutions model',
      content: [
        'The functional solutions model takes a practical, problem-solving approach. It focuses on identifying specific functional challenges and developing tools, technologies, or methods to reduce or eliminate their impact. Rather than debating definitions of disability, this model asks: "What is getting in the way, and how can we fix it?"',
        'This perspective aligns closely with the day-to-day work of accessibility and design professionals. Screen readers, captions, ramps, alternative input devices, and flexible interfaces all fit naturally within this model. Its strength lies in its focus on tangible outcomes and real-world usability.',
        'However, when driven primarily by technology or profit, solutions can miss the mark. Tools may be expensive, impractical, or designed without meaningful input from disabled users. A narrow focus on technical fixes can also overlook social, political, or environmental changes that would address the root cause of a barrier more effectively.'

      heading: 'Social identity or cultural affiliation model',
      content: [
        'This model emphasizes disability as a source of identity, community, and shared culture. Rather than seeing disability as something to overcome, it recognizes that some groups form strong cultural bonds around shared experiences, language, and values. Deaf communities are often cited as a clear example, where sign language, history, and social norms create a rich cultural identity.',
        'For many people, this model offers pride, belonging, and mutual support. Disability is not framed as a deficit, but as a meaningful part of who someone is. This perspective challenges assumptions that all disabilities should be minimized or eliminated.',
        'At the same time, strong group identity can sometimes create boundaries. People who do not fully share the group\'s experiences, communication styles, or values may feel excluded. This model highlights the importance of respecting diversity within disability communities, not just between disabled and non-disabled people.'

      heading: 'Charity model',
      content: [
        'The charity model views disabled people as vulnerable and in need of help from others. Support is framed as generosity, goodwill, or compassion, often delivered through donations or voluntary assistance. This model has historically played a role in mobilizing resources and responding to immediate needs.',
        'While charitable action can be valuable in specific situations, this model often positions disabled people as passive recipients rather than active decision-makers. It can reinforce stereotypes of helplessness and dependency, and may prioritize short-term relief over long-term structural change. Many disabled people find this framing disempowering, especially when it replaces rights-based approaches with pity or moral obligation.'

    {
      heading: 'Conclusion',
      content: [
        'Together, these models illustrate that disability is not a single, simple concept. Each framework influences how problems are defined and which solutions are considered legitimate. Accessibility work is strongest when it recognizes these perspectives, understands their limits, and intentionally chooses approaches that respect both individual experiences and shared responsibility.'
