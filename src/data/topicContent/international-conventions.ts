  introduction: [
    'People with disabilities make up a significant portion of the global population, yet for much of modern history their rights were not explicitly protected in international human rights law. Early human rights instruments focused on universal rights in principle, but often failed to address disability directly or to recognize the specific barriers disabled people face in exercising those rights. Over time, this gap became increasingly visible as disability advocates emphasized that equal rights on paper do not guarantee equal access in practice.',
    'International declarations and conventions now play a crucial role in protecting the rights of people with disabilities. Together, they establish disability as a human rights issue rather than a matter of charity or medical treatment alone. These instruments influence national laws, guide public policy, and provide a shared framework for advancing accessibility, non-discrimination, and full participation in society.'

      heading: 'Disability and International Human Rights',
      content: [
        'International human rights law operates at multiple levels. Some instruments declare fundamental rights that apply to everyone, including people with disabilities. Others prohibit discrimination, either by explicitly naming disability or by covering it under broader categories such as "other status." A smaller number focus directly and specifically on the rights of people with disabilities.',
        'Historically, disability was often addressed indirectly or not at all. For example, people with disabilities were not explicitly named as a protected group in early global human rights documents. Over time, it became clear that without explicit recognition, disabled people remained excluded from education, employment, public life, and access to services—even when general human rights protections existed.',
        'This realization led to the development of disability-specific instruments that clarify how universal rights apply to people with disabilities and what states must do to remove barriers and prevent discrimination.'

      heading: 'The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)',
      content: [
        'The United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a foundational statement of human rights. It was the first global document to set out civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights intended to apply to all people everywhere.',
        'The UDHR does not mention disability explicitly. However, it establishes the principle that all human beings are entitled to rights and freedoms without discrimination. Because of this, it serves as the moral and legal foundation for later treaties, including those that explicitly address disability.',
        'In the context of disability rights, the UDHR matters because it frames accessibility, equality, and participation as universal concerns. Later disability-specific conventions build on this foundation by clarifying how these rights must be realized for people with disabilities in practice.'

    {
      heading: 'Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)',
      content: [
        'The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities represents a major shift in how disability is understood in international law. Adopted by the United Nations in 2006, it was developed in response to the absence of a legally binding treaty that explicitly protected the rights of people with disabilities.',
        'The CRPD moves away from viewing disabled people as objects of charity or medical care. Instead, it recognizes them as rights-holders who can make decisions about their own lives and participate fully in society. The Convention adopts a broad understanding of disability and affirms that all people with disabilities—regardless of type—are entitled to the full range of human rights.',
        'A key feature of the CRPD is that it is legally binding for countries that ratify it. States are not only expected to recognize rights, but also to take concrete steps to implement them. This includes changing laws, policies, and practices that create or maintain barriers.',
        'Accessibility is a central concept within the CRPD. It is listed as a general principle and addressed in detail, particularly in relation to the physical environment, transportation, information and communication, and public services. The Convention makes clear that without accessibility, people with disabilities cannot exercise their rights on an equal basis with others.',
        'The CRPD also establishes an international monitoring process. States must report on their progress, and organizations representing people with disabilities can contribute independent input. This reinforces accountability and ensures that disabled people\'s voices are part of evaluating how rights are implemented.'

      heading: 'The Marrakesh Treaty',
      content: [
        'The Marrakesh Treaty addresses a specific but critical barrier faced by people with print disabilities: access to books and other published materials. It was adopted in 2013 under the administration of the World Intellectual Property Organization.',
        'Before the Treaty, copyright law was a major obstacle to producing and sharing accessible formats such as braille, large print, or audio. As a result, people who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled experienced a severe shortage of accessible reading materials—a situation often described as a "book famine."',
        'The Marrakesh Treaty creates mandatory copyright exceptions that allow accessible versions of published works to be made and shared without requiring permission from copyright holders. It also allows these materials to be exchanged across borders, expanding access globally.',
        'While narrower in scope than the CRPD, the Marrakesh Treaty is a powerful example of how international law can remove structural barriers and directly support accessibility, education, and cultural participation.'

    {
      heading: 'Why These Instruments Matter',
      content: [
        'Together, these declarations and conventions establish disability rights as an integral part of human rights. The UDHR provides the universal foundation, the CRPD clarifies how rights apply to people with disabilities and makes them enforceable, and the Marrakesh Treaty addresses a concrete accessibility barrier affecting access to knowledge.',
        'For accessibility professionals, designers, educators, and policymakers, these instruments provide more than legal context. They articulate a shared global understanding that accessibility is not optional, charitable, or secondary—it is a prerequisite for equality, dignity, and full participation in society.'
