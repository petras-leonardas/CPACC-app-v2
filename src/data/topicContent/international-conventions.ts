  introduction: [
    'About 15% of people in the world live with some form of disability. For a long time, there were no specific international laws that protected their rights. While early human rights papers said everyone should be treated fairly, they often forgot to mention the specific hurdles that people with disabilities face. Over time, it became clear that just saying everyone is equal is not enough if the world is not designed for everyone to use.',
    'Today, international agreements have changed the conversation. They shift the focus away from seeing disability as a medical problem to be fixed or a reason for charity. Instead, they treat accessibility as a fundamental human right. These agreements act like a global rulebook, helping countries write better laws so that every person can participate and contribute to their community.'

      content: [
        'International laws work like a set of safety nets. Some protect everyone, some stop unfair treatment in general, and a few special ones focus entirely on people with disabilities.',
        'In the past, people with disabilities were often left out because laws did not explicitly name them. This meant that even if a country promised "rights for all," people were still being blocked from schools, jobs, and shops. To fix this, new agreements were created to show exactly what needs to be done to remove these barriers.'

        'In 1948, the United Nations wrote the <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong>. This was a huge moment because it was the first time the world agreed on a list of basic rights that belong to every human being.',
        'While this document does not actually use the word "disability," it is still the foundation for everything else. It says that every person is born free and equal. This idea gave disability advocates the spark they needed to say that if everyone is equal, then every building and website should be accessible to everyone, too.'

          heading: 'A big shift in thinking',
          content: 'Adopted in 2006, the <strong>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</strong> changed how the world looks at disability. Instead of seeing people as "objects" to be cared for, it sees them as "subjects" with the power to make their own choices. It is a very popular agreement, with over 180 countries promising to follow it.'

            'The <strong>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</strong> puts accessibility front and center. It says that if a person cannot get into a building or use a website, their human rights are being violated. It requires countries to:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Fix barriers in schools, homes, hospitals, and workplaces.</li><li>Create clear rules for making public services easy to use for everyone.</li><li>Train people on how to be more inclusive.</li><li>Provide information in ways everyone can understand, like using Braille or easy-to-read formats.</li><li>Make sure new technology is designed to be accessible from the very first day.</li></ul>'

They act like a "review board" that checks in on countries to see if they are actually making things better.

        'The <strong>Marrakesh Treaty</strong> was created in 2013 to solve a very specific problem called the "book famine." For a long time, it was very hard to get books in formats like Braille or audio because of strict copyright laws.',
        'This treaty is an international agreement managed by the <strong>World Intellectual Property Organization</strong> (an agency that looks after the rules for creative works). It says that you do not need special permission from a publisher to turn a book into an accessible format for someone who is blind or has trouble reading print. It also lets different countries share these accessible books with each other, so a great story can reach readers all over the planet.'

      heading: 'Why these agreements matter',
      content: 'Together, these documents prove that accessibility is not a "special request"—it is a requirement for a fair world. The <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> gives us the foundation, the <strong>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</strong> gives us the rules, and the <strong>Marrakesh Treaty</strong> helps us share knowledge. For anyone designing a product or running a business, these laws are a reminder that a design is only "good" if everyone can use it.'
