  introduction: [
    'Building accessible information and communication technology (ICT) across an organization is not a one-time effort or a standalone project. It requires an ongoing, coordinated program that is embedded into culture, governance, processes, and everyday decision-making. Organizations that succeed treat accessibility as part of how they design, procure, build, communicate, and evaluate digital products and services—over time and at scale.',
    'This topic brings together practical guidance for adopting an ICT accessibility program, explains how maturity models help organizations understand progress, and highlights why leadership and management champions are essential. The focus is not just on what to do, but on how to sustain accessibility as technology, standards, and organizational priorities evolve.'

          heading: 'Recommended steps to adopt an ICT accessibility plan',
          content: 'Adopting an ICT accessibility program involves four key phases: Initiate, Plan, Implement, and Sustain. Each phase builds on the previous one to create a comprehensive and lasting approach to accessibility.<br/><br/><strong>Initiate:</strong> A successful accessibility program begins with alignment and awareness. Accessibility needs to connect with existing organizational values, risk management, quality assurance, and inclusion goals. Key early actions include: Learning foundational accessibility concepts and standards, developing a clear business case for accessibility, understanding the current digital environment and risks, raising awareness across teams and leadership, setting measurable accessibility objectives, and building initial stakeholder support. This phase focuses on readiness and buy-in, not immediate technical fixes.<br/><br/><strong>Plan:</strong> Planning translates commitment into structure. It clarifies who is responsible, what resources are needed, and how progress will be tracked. Effective planning includes: creating an organizational accessibility policy, assigning clear roles and responsibilities, allocating budget and staffing resources, reviewing existing websites, systems, and tools, establishing monitoring and reporting frameworks, and engaging internal and external stakeholders. Without this foundation, accessibility efforts tend to be fragmented and short-lived.<br/><br/><strong>Implement:</strong> Implementation is where accessibility becomes part of everyday work. Rather than treating accessibility as an add-on, it should be woven into design, development, content creation, and procurement processes. Core implementation practices include: building staff skills and internal expertise, integrating accessibility into existing policies and workflows, assigning tasks and supporting delivery teams, evaluating early and regularly during development, prioritizing issues based on impact and risk, and tracking and communicating progress. Quick wins can help build momentum, but long-term success depends on consistency.<br/><br/><strong>Sustain:</strong> Sustainability ensures that accessibility does not fade once initial goals are met. Ongoing monitoring and adaptation are essential. Sustaining an accessibility program involves: continuously monitoring websites and digital services, maintaining engagement with stakeholders, tracking changes in standards, laws, and technologies, adapting practices as tools and platforms evolve, and incorporating user feedback, including from people with disabilities. Accessibility maturity grows over time through review, learning, and refinement.'
