    'This is a unique situation where a person has both hearing and vision loss. It is a rare condition, affecting between <strong>0.2% and 2%</strong> of the world\'s population. Because they may not be able to rely on sight or sound from a distance, the sense of touch becomes the primary way they communicate. They navigate their surroundings using touch, smell, and taste to gather information that others get from looking or listening.',
    '<strong>Common barriers</strong>:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Lack of tactile sign language interpreters who can provide "Pro-tactile" signing, where signs are made directly onto the person\'s hands so they can "feel" the conversation.</li><li>Digital files that aren\'t built correctly for "Refreshable Braille Displays." These gadgets use tiny pins that pop up to create Braille dots. If a document isn\'t formatted with proper headings, the display might show a confusing jumble of letters instead of a clear sentence.</li></ul>',
