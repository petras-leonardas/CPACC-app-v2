For someone with multiple disabilities, "switching" between different tools and strategies all day can lead to total exhaustion.</li><li><strong>"One Path" Design</strong>: If a website only has one way to get from point A to point B, and that path is blocked for any reason, the user is completely stuck. Providing multiple ways to finish a task is the best way to support complex needs.</li></ul>',
