  content: [
    'Mobility, flexibility, and body-structure disabilities affect a person\'s ability to move their body purposefully and safely. This includes walking, reaching, gripping, maintaining posture, sustaining physical effort, and performing fine motor actions. These disabilities are not limited to wheelchair use and are often highly variable over time.',
    'Some people experience permanent mobility impairments, others experience temporary limitations (such as injury), and many experience episodic or fluctuating limitations, where fatigue, pain, or stiffness changes from day to day. Environmental design plays a major role in determining whether these limitations become disabling.'

        '<strong>Fine motor / dexterity limitations:</strong> Difficulty with small, precise movements such as typing, tapping small buttons, turning knobs, fastening clothing, or handling tools. Dexterity may be affected by neurological conditions, arthritis, tremors, injury, or fatigue.',
        '<strong>Ambulation limitations:</strong> Ambulation refers to the ability to walk independently, with or without an assistive device. Limitations may involve balance, endurance, joint stability, pain, or safety. Distance, slope, surface texture, and availability of rest all matter.',
        '<strong>Fatigue and reduced stamina:</strong> Some people experience muscle fatigue or low endurance that limits how long they can stand, walk, or interact physically—even if they appear physically capable for short periods. Fatigue can be invisible and episodic.',
        '<strong>Body size or shape–related barriers:</strong> Disabilities related to stature, proportions, joint mobility, or body mass can make standard furniture, controls, and spaces unusable or unsafe. Barriers often arise not from the body itself, but from rigid assumptions about a "standard" body.'
