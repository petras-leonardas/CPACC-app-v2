For someone with a hand tremor or arthritis, trying to hit a small "X" to close an ad can feel like a game of high-stakes surgery.</li><li><strong>Ambulation</strong>: Stairs, high curbs, or heavy doors. If a shop has even one small step at the entrance, a person in a wheelchair is physically barred from entering that business, no matter how much they want to shop there.</li><li><strong>Fatigue</strong>: Designing a building where the only "accessible" entrance is hidden at the back of the building. By the time the person reaches the door, they may have already used up all their energy for the day just trying to get inside.</li></ul>',
