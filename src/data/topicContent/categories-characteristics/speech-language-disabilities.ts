    'Speech and language disabilities are related but distinct. Language involves understanding and expressing ideas through words, symbols, reading, and writing. Speech involves the physical production of sounds. A person may have difficulty speaking clearly while having strong language comprehension, or they may have language impairment even if speech sounds intact.',
    'These disabilities often require time, flexibility, and alternative communication pathways, rather than assumptions about intelligence or competence.'

        '<strong>Speech sound differences:</strong> These range from mild slurring to severe difficulty producing intelligible speech. Speech clarity may vary by fatigue, stress, or environment.',
        '<strong>Motor-planning or muscle-control impacts:</strong> Conditions such as apraxia or dysarthria can make speech slow, inconsistent, or difficult to coordinate, even when the person knows exactly what they want to say.',
        '<strong>No functional speech (mutism):</strong> Mutism may have neurological causes, psychological causes, or a combination. It does not imply lack of language comprehension.',
        '<strong>Aphasia:</strong> Aphasia is a language disorder caused by brain injury (most commonly stroke). It can affect speaking, understanding speech, reading, and writing. Different forms of aphasia affect different aspects of language.'
