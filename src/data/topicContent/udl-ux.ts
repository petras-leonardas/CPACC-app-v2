  introduction: [
    'Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an instructional framework that helps educators design learning experiences that work for a wide range of learners from the beginning. Rather than assuming a single "average" learner, UDL is based on cognitive science and recognizes that people vary in how they engage with material, how they understand information, and how they demonstrate what they know. The core idea is flexibility: providing multiple ways to access learning, stay motivated, and show understanding.',
    'Alongside UDL, concepts such as usability, user experience (UX), and user-centered design shape how products, services, and learning environments are created. These ideas emphasize ease of use, satisfaction, trust, and effectiveness. Accessibility is a foundational part of this picture, ensuring that people with disabilities can participate fully. Together, UDL, usability, and UX support inclusive experiences that are not only accessible, but also effective and meaningful.'

        'Universal Design for Learning is a framework for designing instruction that anticipates learner diversity. It emphasizes that variability is the norm, not the exception. Learners differ in motivation, background knowledge, sensory abilities, language, culture, attention, and executive functioning. UDL responds to this reality by encouraging instructors to build flexibility into learning goals, materials, methods, and assessments.',
        'The UDL framework was developed and is maintained by Center for Applied Special Technology. It is grounded in research on how people learn and how learning is affected by emotion, perception, and action. Instead of retrofitting instruction for individual students, UDL aims to reduce barriers at the design stage so more learners can succeed without needing special arrangements.'

            'Engagement focuses on motivation and emotional involvement in learning. Learners differ widely in what captures their interest, what sustains their effort, and how they respond to challenge. Some thrive on novelty and collaboration, while others prefer routine or independent work.',
            'To support engagement, instructors should provide options that:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Spark and sustain learners\' interest</li><li>Help learners persist through effort and challenges</li><li>Support self-regulation, including managing emotions, stress, and motivation</li></ul>',
            'By offering choices and supportive structures, engagement becomes more inclusive and responsive to individual needs.'

            'Representation addresses how information is presented and understood. Learners vary in how they perceive and process information. Sensory disabilities, learning differences, language backgrounds, and prior knowledge all influence comprehension.',
            'To support representation, instructors should provide options that:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Present information through multiple sensory modalities (such as text, audio, visuals, and demonstrations)</li><li>Clarify language, symbols, and key concepts</li><li>Support comprehension through structure, scaffolding, and connections between ideas</li></ul>',

            'Action and expression focus on how learners interact with materials and show what they know. Learners differ in physical abilities, communication styles, and executive functioning skills such as planning and organization.',
            'To support action and expression, instructors should provide options that:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Make interaction with tools and environments physically accessible</li><li>Allow different ways to communicate understanding (such as writing, speaking, visual work, or projects)</li><li>Support executive functions through guidance, practice, and scaffolding</li></ul>',
            'Offering flexible ways to act and express knowledge helps learners demonstrate their strengths rather than being limited by a single format.'

      content: [
        'Usability and user experience are closely related but distinct concepts. Usability focuses on whether something is easy to learn, easy to use, and effective for accomplishing tasks. A usable system allows users to achieve their goals efficiently and with minimal confusion.',
        'User experience is broader. It includes usability, but also encompasses how people feel about a product or service over time. UX includes first impressions, trust, satisfaction, emotional response, and the overall quality of interactions across the entire lifecycle of use.',
        'Accessibility is a core component of good UX. If a product cannot be used by people with disabilities, the experience is incomplete. At the same time, usability alone is not enough to guarantee a positive experience—content quality, visual design, interaction design, and credibility all play important roles.'

      content: [
        'User-centered design is an approach that places users at the heart of the design and development process. Its goal is to ensure that products and services genuinely meet users\' needs rather than forcing users to adapt to poorly designed systems.',
        'Key elements of user-centered design include:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Involving users early and throughout the design process through research and testing</li><li>Using iterative cycles of design, feedback, and refinement</li><li>Including accessibility considerations and testing as part of regular design practice</li></ul>',
        'When user-centered design includes people with diverse abilities, it naturally supports accessibility, usability, and better user experiences overall.',
        'Universal Design for Learning, usability, and user experience all share a common goal: creating experiences that work for real people in real contexts. By designing with flexibility, clarity, and inclusion in mind, educators and designers can reduce barriers, support diverse needs, and create environments where more people can learn, use, and succeed.'
