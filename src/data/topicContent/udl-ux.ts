    'When we design a classroom, a website, or a new gadget, we have a choice. We can design for one "average" person and hope everyone else can catch up, or we can design with the idea that everyone is different from the very start. This second path is where the magic happens. By using flexible frameworks and focusing on the human beings who will actually use our creations, we make the world a more welcoming place for everyone.',

        'Universal Design for Learning is a way of teaching that expects and celebrates the fact that every student is different. Instead of waiting for a student to ask for help because a lesson is too hard to read or hear, teachers use UDL to build flexibility into the lesson from day one. It is based on the idea that there is no such thing as an "average" learner. We all have different backgrounds, different ways of paying attention, and different ways of showing what we know.',
        'This framework was created and is looked after by the <strong>Center for Applied Special Technology</strong>. (This is a nonprofit organization that uses research to make learning better for everyone). It is built on the idea that we should fix the "clunky" design of a lesson rather than trying to "fix" the student.',

Some people love a surprise and working in a big group, while others feel much safer with a strict routine and a quiet corner to work in. To make sure everyone stays motivated, teachers should:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Give students choices to help them get interested in the topic.</li><li>Help students keep going even when the work gets tough.</li><li>Teach students how to manage their own feelings and stress while they learn.</li></ul>',

            'Representation is how we share information. Because everyone perceives the world differently—some might have trouble seeing, some might have trouble hearing, and others might speak a different language—one way of sharing information is never enough. To help everyone understand, teachers should:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Share information in many ways, like using videos, audio recordings, or hands-on activities instead of just a textbook.</li><li>Explain symbols and difficult words so no one gets lost.</li><li>Use patterns and big-picture ideas to help students connect what they are learning to what they already know.</li></ul>',

Others might be brilliant at building a model but struggle with a multiple-choice test. To let everyone shine, teachers should:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Make sure the tools students use (like computers or lab equipment) are easy for everyone to physically handle.</li><li>Allow students to choose how they "tell" what they know, such as through a drawing, a video, or a story.</li><li>Help students learn how to plan their work and set goals for themselves.</li></ul>',

      content: [
        'While UDL focuses on learning, usability and user experience focus on how we interact with things like apps or websites.',
        'Usability is a specific measure of whether a tool is easy to use. (Think of this as the "Can I get this done?" part of design). If a website is usable, you can find what you need quickly without getting frustrated.',
        'User experience is a much bigger idea. It includes usability, but it also looks at how you feel while using something. (Think of this as the "How do I feel about this?" part of design). It covers things like whether you trust the website, if it looks beautiful, and if you feel satisfied after using it.',
        'Accessibility is a huge part of a great user experience. If a person with a disability cannot use a product, that product has a "bad" user experience because it has left someone out of the party.',

      content: [
        'User-centered design is a strategy where we put the human being at the heart of everything we make. Instead of making a product and then telling people how to use it, we talk to people first to see what they actually need.',
        'To do this well, designers should:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Talk to many different kinds of people—including people with disabilities—at the very beginning of the project.</li><li>Build a simple version of the product, get feedback, and then fix it. (This is called an "iterative" process, which is just a fancy way of saying we keep practicing until we get it right).</li><li>Make sure that checking for accessibility is a normal part of every single day, not just something checked at the very end.</li></ul>',
        'By using Universal Design for Learning and focusing on the user, we stop seeing disability as a problem to be solved and start seeing it as a natural part of being human that we can easily design for.',
