  introduction: [
    'Disability etiquette is really just a fancy way of saying "being a good human." It is a set of social habits that help us treat everyone with respect and dignity. Think of it like a map for a conversation: it helps you avoid bumps in the road, keeps things from getting awkward, and makes sure everyone can join the fun. Instead of guessing what someone needs based on their disability, etiquette teaches us to see the person first and let them lead the way.',
    'In our daily lives and at work, these habits change how we talk, how we offer a hand, and how we write. When we practice good etiquette, we recognize that people with disabilities are the true experts on their own lives. We aren\'t trying to follow a strict set of "medical rules." Instead, we are just making sure everyone has an equal seat at the table.',

        'Disability etiquette is basically the shared social "vibe" that guides how we talk to and about people. These aren\'t just rules for when you are standing right in front of someone. They also apply to how we write emails, run meetings, and create new products. Good etiquette isn\'t about being perfect every single time. It is about having a good heart, being aware of others, and being willing to learn if you make a mistake.',
        'Because everyone is different, there is no single "correct" way to do everything. What feels respectful to one person might feel different to another. The main goal is to treat people with disabilities as full partners in life who are perfectly capable of making their own decisions and sharing what they like.',

      heading: 'Talking and hanging out together',
      content: [
        'One of the biggest "pro-tips" for etiquette is direct communication. When you are talking to someone who has a disability, look at them and speak directly to them. Even if they have a sign language interpreter or a friend with them, keep your focus on the person you are actually chatting with. This shows that you respect their independence and recognize them as the person in charge of the conversation.',
        'It is also important to stop making assumptions. Disability looks different on everyone, even if two people have the same diagnosis. Assuming someone "can\'t" do something is like deciding someone doesn\'t like cake before you even offer them a slice. Instead of guessing, just let the person show you what they can do.',
        'When it comes to helping out, always ask first. It is a bit like being a waiter at a restaurant: you wouldn\'t just grab someone\'s plate and start cutting their food without asking, right? If you see someone who might need a hand, ask if they want help. If they say "yes," ask how they want you to do it. If they say "no," that is okay too! Respecting their answer shows you value their power to handle things themselves.',
        'Lastly, remember that personal space is a big deal. For many people, things like wheelchairs, canes, or service animals are like an extension of their own bodies. Touching someone\'s wheelchair without asking is just as rude as grabbing someone\'s arm or ruffling their hair. Always keep a respectful distance from someone\'s equipment unless they ask you to help.',

        'Disability etiquette is built on the idea of autonomy.',
        'Autonomy is the right of a person to make their own choices and be the boss of their own life.',
        'This means we should trust people with disabilities to know what works best for them, whether it is choosing a way to communicate or deciding which accommodations they need. In a professional setting, this means including people in every conversation that affects them. Never make a plan "for" someone without having them in the room to speak for themselves.',

    {
      heading: 'Why the words we choose matter',
      content: [
        'The words we use act like a mirror that reflects how we see the world. Inclusive language is all about using words that don\'t make disability seem like a "problem" or something to be sad about. One common way to do this is through people-first language.',
        'People-first language is a way of speaking that puts the person before the disability, such as saying "a person who uses a wheelchair" instead of "a wheelchair user."',
        'However, not everyone likes the same labels. Some people prefer identity-first language.',
        'Identity-first language is a way of speaking where the disability is a proud part of who the person is, such as saying "an autistic person" instead of "a person with autism."',
        'Since everyone has a different preference, the best thing to do is just ask! If you aren\'t sure how someone likes to be described, follow their lead. When you are writing for a big group of people, try to stay neutral. Avoid words that make people sound like "victims" or "heroes" just for living their daily lives.',

      content: 'Good etiquette isn\'t just for one-on-one chats. It should be built into the DNA of our companies and organizations. This means our official policies and the way we design our systems should always show respect and inclusion. Practicing these habits is a journey that never really ends. It requires us to listen, stay open to feedback, and change our behavior as we learn more. When we do this consistently, we create a world where everyone is seen as a peer, a teammate, and a leader.',
