  introduction: [
    'Disability etiquette is about interacting with people with disabilities in ways that are respectful, inclusive, and grounded in basic human dignity. It is not a rigid rulebook, but a shared set of social practices that help avoid harm, reduce awkwardness, and support equal participation. At its core, disability etiquette emphasizes seeing people as individuals first, rather than defining them by assumptions about their bodies, minds, or abilities.',
    'In professional and everyday contexts, disability etiquette influences how we speak, how we offer help, how we make decisions, and how we refer to people in conversation and writing. Practicing good etiquette means being attentive to language, behavior, and power dynamics, and recognizing that people with disabilities are the best authorities on their own needs, preferences, and experiences.'

      content: [
        'Disability etiquette refers to shared social norms that guide respectful interaction and communication. These norms apply both to direct, face-to-face interactions and to how people with disabilities are discussed in writing, meetings, products, and policies. Good etiquette is less about perfection and more about intention, awareness, and willingness to learn.',
        'Because disability experiences vary widely, etiquette focuses on flexibility rather than one-size-fits-all rules. What is respectful in one situation or culture may not be in another. The guiding principle is to treat people with disabilities as full participants in social and professional life, capable of making decisions and expressing preferences for themselves.'

      heading: 'Interacting directly with people with disabilities',
      content: [
        'One of the most important principles of disability etiquette is direct communication. When speaking with someone who has a disability, address them directly rather than speaking through a companion, interpreter, or assistant. This reinforces respect and acknowledges the person\'s autonomy.',
        'Avoid making assumptions about what someone can or cannot do. Disabilities affect people differently, even when they share the same diagnosis. Assumptions—whether overly negative or overly positive—can be limiting and dismissive. Instead, allow the person to define their own capabilities.',
        'Offering help should also be handled thoughtfully. Assistance should be provided only when it is requested, or after asking permission. Unsolicited help, even when well intentioned, can be intrusive or disempowering. Asking first allows the person to accept, decline, or guide the assistance in a way that works for them.',
        'Respect for personal space and privacy is equally important. Mobility aids, assistive devices, and service animals are part of a person\'s personal space. Touching a wheelchair, cane, communication device, or other equipment without permission is equivalent to touching the person themselves and should be avoided.'

      heading: 'Respecting autonomy and decision-making',
      content: [
        'Disability etiquette recognizes that people with disabilities are capable of making decisions about their own lives. This includes decisions about accommodations, communication methods, and levels of assistance. Avoid speaking as if someone lacks agency or judgment simply because they have a disability.',
        'In professional settings, this means including people with disabilities in conversations that affect them, rather than making decisions on their behalf. In everyday interactions, it means listening, trusting self-reported needs, and respecting boundaries.'

      heading: 'Inclusive language and its role',
      content: [
        'Language plays a powerful role in shaping attitudes toward disability. Inclusive language aims to reduce stigma and avoid framing disability as a defining flaw or limitation. One widely recommended approach is people-first language, which places the person before the disability, emphasizing that disability is one aspect of a person rather than their entire identity.',
        'However, language preferences are not universal. Some people and communities prefer identity-first language, which treats disability as an integral and valued part of identity rather than something separate. This approach is often embraced within disability communities as a form of self-definition and pride.',
        'Because preferences vary, the most respectful approach in direct communication is to ask individuals how they prefer to be described and to follow their lead. When writing or speaking more generally, it is important to use neutral, respectful terms and avoid language that implies pity, tragedy, or heroism.'

      content: [
        'Disability etiquette is not limited to interpersonal behavior. It also affects how organizations communicate, design systems, and establish norms. Policies, documentation, and public messaging should reflect respect, accuracy, and inclusion rather than stereotypes or outdated language.',
        'Practicing disability etiquette is an ongoing process. It involves reflection, openness to feedback, and a willingness to adjust behavior as understanding grows. When applied consistently, it supports more inclusive environments where people with disabilities are respected as peers, collaborators, and decision-makers.'
