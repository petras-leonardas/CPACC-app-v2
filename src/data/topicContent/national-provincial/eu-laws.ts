    'In the European Union, disability rights are shaped by both EU-level directives and national legislation. A key instrument is the Employment Equality Directive, adopted in 2000. This directive prohibits disability discrimination in employment and occupation and requires reasonable accommodation.',
    'All EU Member States have implemented the directive into national law, but broader disability equality laws vary widely. A proposed directive to extend equal treatment beyond employment has not been adopted, resulting in differences between countries in areas such as healthcare, education, and access to services.',
    'As a result, national approaches within the EU range from comprehensive anti-discrimination frameworks to more limited protections. This variation highlights how shared principles can be implemented differently depending on legal traditions and policy priorities.'

  content: [
    'National and provincial disability rights laws are where rights become enforceable. They determine whether people can challenge discrimination, access remedies, and expect accessible environments as a matter of law rather than goodwill.',
    'Although these laws differ in scope and detail, they share a common purpose: recognizing people with disabilities as rights-holders and requiring societies to remove barriers that prevent full participation. Together, they form a critical link between international human rights principles and everyday accessibility practice.'
