    'The <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong>, or ADA, is the "gold standard" of civil rights laws in the United States. It makes sure that people with disabilities have the same "fair shot" at life as everyone else.',
    'The <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> covers five big areas:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Public places (like cafes, hotels, and doctors\' offices).</li><li>Jobs (how people are hired and treated at work).</li><li>Transportation (buses and trains).</li><li>Government services (like voting and public schools).</li><li>Phone services (making sure everyone can communicate).</li></ul>',
    'When the US Congress—the group of people who make laws for the United States—wrote the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong>, they found that millions of Americans were being left out on purpose or by accident. They realized that excluding people doesn\'t just hurt individuals—it costs the whole country billions of dollars because so much talent is being wasted.',
