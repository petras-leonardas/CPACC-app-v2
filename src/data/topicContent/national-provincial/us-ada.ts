  heading: 'The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (United States)',
  content: [
    'The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a landmark civil rights law that puts in place protections for people with disabilities, similar to those provided on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. By framing disability discrimination as a civil rights issue, the ADA fundamentally changed how disability is understood in American law and society.'

      heading: 'Scope of protections',
      content: 'The ADA guarantees equal opportunities for people with disabilities in five key areas:<br/><br/><ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Public accommodations (restaurants, hotels, theaters, stores, healthcare facilities, and other places open to the public)</li><li>Employment (hiring, advancement, and workplace practices)</li><li>Transportation (buses, trains, and other public transit systems)</li><li>State and local government services (courts, public schools, social services)</li><li>Telecommunications (phone and communication services)</li></ul><br/>By covering these essential areas of daily life, the ADA aims to ensure that people with disabilities can participate fully in society on an equal basis with others.'

      heading: 'Congressional findings on discrimination',
      content: 'The Findings of <strong>Chapter 126, Equal Opportunity for Individuals with Disabilities</strong>, document the nature and extent of disability discrimination in the United States. Congress found that:<br/><br/>Physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person\'s right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination. This includes people who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability.<br/><br/>Historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.<br/><br/>Discrimination persists in critical areas including employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services.<br/><br/>Unlike individuals who experienced discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who experienced disability discrimination often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination before the ADA.'

    {
      heading: 'Forms of discrimination',
      content: 'The ADA recognizes that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination:<br/><br/><ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Outright intentional exclusion</li><li>Discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers</li><li>Overprotective rules and policies</li><li>Failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices</li><li>Exclusionary qualification standards and criteria</li><li>Segregation and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities</li></ul><br/>This recognition is significant because it acknowledges that discrimination can be both intentional and structural—embedded in the design of environments, policies, and systems.'

      heading: 'National goals and impact',
      content: 'Congress declared that the nation\'s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Equality of opportunity</li><li>Full participation</li><li>Independent living</li><li>Economic self-sufficiency</li></ul><br/>The findings also noted that census data, national polls, and other studies documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupied an inferior status in society and were severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.<br/><br/>Congress recognized that the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and non-productivity.<br/><br/>The ADA addresses both accessibility—such as requirements for public spaces and services—and reasonable accommodation, particularly in employment. It has had a significant influence on disability rights legislation globally, serving as a model for civil rights–based disability laws in many countries.'
