  heading: 'How disability laws have grown up',
  content: [
    'Since the 1990s, laws protecting the civil rights of people with disabilities have popped up all over the globe. This reflects a huge shift in how we think about disability. Instead of looking at a person\'s medical condition as a "problem" to be solved, we now look at how society can change its rules and buildings to be more welcoming.',
    'The United States really led the way when it passed the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> on July 26, 1990. This was a massive win that showed the rest of the world how to write laws based on civil rights. Soon after, thirty-three different countries in Europe followed suit, creating their own protections over the next 25 years.',

        'Old-school policies focused mostly on giving out welfare checks. While financial support is helpful, it didn\'t actually stop people from being left out. This old "medical model" viewed people with disabilities as patients who needed help.',
        'The new "social model" is much more exciting! It says that people are "disabled" by broken elevators, websites that don\'t work with screen readers, or unfair hiring rules—not by their own bodies. Modern laws now tell governments and companies that they have a job to do: remove those hurdles.',
        'There are two main reasons this change happened:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li><strong>Disability activism:</strong> People with disabilities spoke up and demanded to be treated as equals.</li><li><strong>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities:</strong> This 2006 agreement by the United Nations—an international group that works for global peace and safety—encouraged countries to make their local laws much stronger.</li></ul>',

        'Modern laws treat disability as a "discrimination category." This means having a disability is just one part of who a person is, like their race or religion, and it\'s illegal to treat them worse because of it. It changes accessibility from a "favor" into a "right."',
        'These laws often give very specific checklists for:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Buildings and architecture.</li><li>Jobs and the workplace.</li><li>Schools and classrooms.</li><li>Shops, hotels, and theaters.</li></ul>',
