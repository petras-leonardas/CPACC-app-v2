      heading: 'The spread of disability rights legislation',
      content: 'The United States adopted the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990 as one of several landmark US disability-related laws. This set a precedent for civil rights–based disability legislation globally.<br/><br/>In Europe, thirty-three countries adopted at least some form of disability equality protections over a 25-year period. This rapid spread reflects growing international recognition that disability discrimination is a human rights issue requiring legal protection.'

      heading: 'From welfare to equality',
      content: 'Earlier disability policies often focused on welfare benefits or social security. While these supports remain important, they did not address systemic barriers or unequal treatment. This welfare model was rooted in a medical understanding of disability that viewed disabled people primarily as recipients of charity or assistance.<br/><br/>The move from the medical to the social model of disability has been a main driver of the legal shift from welfare law toward anti-discrimination or equality law. The social model recognizes that barriers, exclusion, and unequal treatment—not individual impairments—are what disable people in society.<br/><br/>Modern disability rights laws challenge segregation and exclusion as forms of discrimination. They require social institutions—governments, corporations, educational institutions, and individuals—to reduce or eliminate discrimination rather than simply providing benefits.'

      heading: 'Key drivers of change',
      content: 'Two pivotal factors have driven the integration of disability rights into national law:<br/><br/><strong>Disability activism and the social model:</strong> Advocacy by disabled people and their organizations has been critical in shifting how disability is understood. The social model reframes disability as a matter of rights and equality rather than charity or medical treatment.<br/><br/><strong>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD):</strong> Adopted in 2006, the CRPD encouraged countries worldwide to align their domestic laws with a rights-based approach and to recognize accessibility as a precondition for equality. It has been one of the most influential international instruments in shaping national disability legislation.'

      heading: 'Treating disability as a discrimination category',
      content: 'Most modern disability laws share an equality focus rather than a focus on fostering social welfare provisions alone. Disability discrimination laws are considered a truly new development in disability policy around the world.<br/><br/>Laws that treat disability as a discrimination category recognize that people with disabilities are people with rights rather than problems. This fundamental shift means that disabled people can challenge discrimination, demand equal treatment, and expect accessibility as a legal right—not as a favor or accommodation granted out of goodwill.<br/><br/>Some disability civil rights laws include prescriptive guidelines or checklists for measuring accessibility in areas such as:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Architecture and the built environment</li><li>Employment and the workplace</li><li>Educational settings</li><li>Retail venues, hospitality, and entertainment</li></ul>'
