    'The Ontarians with Disabilities Act 2001 reflects a provincial commitment to inclusion and equality in Canada. It recognizes the right of people with disabilities to participate fully in the social, economic, and cultural life of Ontario.',
    'The Act acknowledges that barriers exist across society and that these barriers are likely to increase as the population ages. It places responsibility for barrier removal and prevention across all sectors, including government, organizations, institutions, and individuals.',
    'Rather than focusing solely on individual complaints, the Act emphasizes systemic change. Its purpose is to prevent new barriers from being created and to identify and remove existing ones, reinforcing accessibility as a shared responsibility.'
