      heading: 'Purpose and scope',
      content: 'The Act requires "the exercise of certain functions to be with regard to the need to eliminate discrimination." This means that public bodies, employers, service providers, and others must actively consider equality in their decision-making and operations.<br/><br/>The Act protects people from discrimination in key areas of life, including employment, education, housing, transport, and access to goods and services. By consolidating earlier laws into a single framework, it creates clearer and more consistent protections across these areas.'

Disability is one of nine protected characteristics:<br/><br/><ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Age</li><li><strong>Disability</strong></li><li>Gender reassignment</li><li>Marriage and civil partnership</li><li>Pregnancy and maternity</li><li>Race</li><li>Religion or belief</li><li>Sex</li><li>Sexual orientation</li></ul><br/>By listing disability alongside other protected characteristics, the Act affirms that disability discrimination is a form of discrimination comparable to discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or other grounds.'

      heading: 'Types of discrimination',
      content: 'The Act prohibits several forms of discrimination against people with disabilities:<br/><br/><strong>Direct discrimination:</strong> Treating someone less favorably because of their disability.<br/><br/><strong>Discrimination arising from disability:</strong> Unfavorable treatment because of something arising as a consequence of a person\'s disability. This recognizes that disability-related effects—such as needing time off for medical appointments or using mobility aids—can be the basis for discrimination.<br/><br/><strong>Indirect discrimination:</strong> The use of a criterion or practice that is discriminatory in relation to the protected characteristic. This occurs when a rule or policy that applies to everyone has the effect of disadvantaging people with disabilities.'

      heading: 'Specific disability provisions',
      content: 'The Act includes various provisions directly related to the rights of people with disabilities:<br/><br/><ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Accessibility of transport systems and services</li><li>Accessibility requirements for disabled students in educational settings</li><li>Restrictions on when employers can ask job applicants about disability or health</li><li>Requirements for reasonable adjustments in employment and service provision</li></ul><br/>These specific provisions recognize that disability equality requires both general non-discrimination protections and targeted measures to address barriers in specific contexts. The Act\'s overall purpose is to promote fairness, inclusion, and equal participation in society.'
