    'In the United Kingdom, they gathered a bunch of different laws and tucked them into one big, strong package called the <strong>Equality Act 2010</strong>. This law covers people in England, Scotland, and Wales.',
    'It tells public groups and employers that they can\'t just sit back—they have to actively think about how to be fair. It lists "disability" as one of nine "protected characteristics." These are specific traits, like age or race, that the law says you cannot use as a reason to treat someone unfairly.',
    'The <strong>Equality Act 2010</strong> stops three main types of unfairness:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li><strong>Direct discrimination:</strong> Being mean or unfair to someone specifically because they have a disability.</li><li><strong>Discrimination arising from disability:</strong> Being unfair because of something related to a disability, like needing a service dog or a quiet space.</li><li><strong>Indirect discrimination:</strong> Having a rule that applies to everyone but accidentally makes things much harder for people with disabilities.</li></ul>',
