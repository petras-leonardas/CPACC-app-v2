  introduction: [
    'National and provincial disability rights laws translate human rights principles into enforceable obligations within specific countries or regions. These laws shape how equality, accessibility, and inclusion are implemented in everyday life—across employment, education, transportation, public services, and the built and digital environments. While international and regional treaties set shared expectations, it is national and provincial legislation that most directly affects people\'s lived experiences.',
    'Over the past few decades, disability-related laws have increasingly shifted away from charity and welfare models toward equality and anti-discrimination frameworks. This change reflects a broader move from viewing disability as an individual problem to recognizing it as a social issue shaped by barriers, exclusion, and unequal treatment. As a result, modern disability laws tend to emphasize rights, participation, and systemic change rather than assistance alone.'

This set a precedent for civil rights–based disability legislation globally.<br/><br/>In Europe, thirty-three countries adopted at least some form of disability equality protections over a 25-year period. This rapid spread reflects growing international recognition that disability discrimination is a human rights issue requiring legal protection.'

          heading: 'From welfare to equality',
          content: 'Earlier disability policies often focused on welfare benefits or social security. While these supports remain important, they did not address systemic barriers or unequal treatment. This welfare model was rooted in a medical understanding of disability that viewed disabled people primarily as recipients of charity or assistance.<br/><br/>The move from the medical to the social model of disability has been a main driver of the legal shift from welfare law toward anti-discrimination or equality law. The social model recognizes that barriers, exclusion, and unequal treatment—not individual impairments—are what disable people in society.<br/><br/>Modern disability rights laws challenge segregation and exclusion as forms of discrimination. They require social institutions—governments, corporations, educational institutions, and individuals—to reduce or eliminate discrimination rather than simply providing benefits.'

          heading: 'Key drivers of change',
          content: 'Two pivotal factors have driven the integration of disability rights into national law:<br/><br/><strong>Disability activism and the social model:</strong> Advocacy by disabled people and their organizations has been critical in shifting how disability is understood. The social model reframes disability as a matter of rights and equality rather than charity or medical treatment.<br/><br/><strong>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD):</strong> Adopted in 2006, the CRPD encouraged countries worldwide to align their domestic laws with a rights-based approach and to recognize accessibility as a precondition for equality. It has been one of the most influential international instruments in shaping national disability legislation.'

          heading: 'Treating disability as a discrimination category',
          content: 'Most modern disability laws share an equality focus rather than a focus on fostering social welfare provisions alone. Disability discrimination laws are considered a truly new development in disability policy around the world.<br/><br/>Laws that treat disability as a discrimination category recognize that people with disabilities are people with rights rather than problems. This fundamental shift means that disabled people can challenge discrimination, demand equal treatment, and expect accessibility as a legal right—not as a favor or accommodation granted out of goodwill.<br/><br/>Some disability civil rights laws include prescriptive guidelines or checklists for measuring accessibility in areas such as:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Architecture and the built environment</li><li>Employment and the workplace</li><li>Educational settings</li><li>Retail venues, hospitality, and entertainment</li></ul>'

        {
          heading: 'Reasonable accommodation',
          content: 'Reasonable accommodation (also called individual accommodation) aims to ensure equal treatment on a case-by-case basis. It addresses individual needs in specific situations by requiring adjustments or modifications—such as flexible work arrangements, assistive technology, or alternative formats—so that a person with a disability can participate equally.<br/><br/>The <strong>EU Employment Directive</strong> (Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation) provides a comprehensive description of reasonable accommodation in employment:<br/><br/>"In order to guarantee compliance with the principle of equal treatment in relation to persons with disabilities, reasonable accommodation shall be provided. This means that employers shall take appropriate measures, where needed in a particular case, to enable a person with a disability to have access to, participate in, or advance in employment, or to undergo training, unless such measures would impose a disproportionate burden on the employer."<br/><br/>Accommodation is typically required unless it would impose an undue or disproportionate burden. This acknowledges that while equality is the goal, there are practical limits based on cost, organizational capacity, and other factors.'

        {
          heading: 'Accessibility',
          content: 'Accessibility focuses on creating environments, services, and systems that are usable by everyone, regardless of disability status. Unlike reasonable accommodation, accessibility requirements apply broadly and proactively—the conditions should be met regardless of whether a person with a disability is present or has made a request.<br/><br/><strong>Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act of 1973</strong> exemplifies this approach. It requires that when federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, they must ensure it allows:<br/><br/>"individuals with disabilities who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal department or agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by such members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities."<br/><br/>This means digital services, public buildings, transportation systems, and other resources must meet specific accessibility standards so that people with disabilities do not have to request special treatment or identify themselves as disabled to access basic services.'

        {
          heading: 'Complementary approaches',
          content: 'Together, accessibility and reasonable accommodation reflect the idea that equality requires both inclusive design and individual flexibility. Accessibility ensures that environments are usable from the start, while reasonable accommodation addresses situations where individual needs require specific adjustments.<br/><br/>Both approaches are essential. Accessibility alone cannot address every individual need, and reasonable accommodation alone places too much burden on individuals to request adjustments. Effective disability rights laws combine both approaches to create truly inclusive societies.'

Congress found that:<br/><br/>Physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person\'s right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination. This includes people who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability.<br/><br/>Historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.<br/><br/>Discrimination persists in critical areas including employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services.<br/><br/>Unlike individuals who experienced discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who experienced disability discrimination often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination before the ADA.'
