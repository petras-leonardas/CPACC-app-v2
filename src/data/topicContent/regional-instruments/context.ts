    'Regional agreements are important because they can often move faster than global ones. If a new problem pops up that specifically affects one part of the world, neighboring countries can team up to solve it quickly.',
    'These agreements also provide a path to justice. If someone feels their rights aren\'t being respected, they can take their case to a regional court. These courts can make decisions that governments must follow, which helps turn "paper rights" into real-life changes. In the world of disability rights, these regional groups were often the first to say that everyone should be included in community life.'

    'Regional rules don\'t replace global ones; they work together like a team. Global rules set the standard for the whole world, while regional rules make sure those standards actually work in specific neighborhoods.',
    'By having these different layers of protection, we make sure that disability rights aren\'t just an abstract idea, but a lived reality. It ensures that wherever you are in the world, the goal is the same: making sure every person can participate, contribute, and belong.'
