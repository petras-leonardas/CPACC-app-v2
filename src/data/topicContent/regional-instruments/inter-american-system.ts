      heading: 'Overview and significance',
      content: [
        'The Organization of American States adopted the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities in 1999 in Guatemala. This convention predates the global CRPD by seven years, making it the first binding regional treaty that expressly prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities.',
        'By addressing disability rights explicitly before the global framework emerged, the Inter-American Convention demonstrated regional leadership and helped shape thinking about how disability rights should be protected in international law.'

    {
      heading: 'Core objectives',
      content: [
        '<strong>Article II</strong> of the convention establishes its fundamental purpose: to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination against persons with disabilities and to promote their full integration into society.',
        'These twin objectives—ending discrimination and promoting integration—reflect an understanding that removing barriers alone is not enough. The convention recognizes that states must actively work to ensure people with disabilities can participate fully in all aspects of community life.'

    {
      heading: 'Accessibility provisions',
      content: [
        'The convention addresses accessibility directly and comprehensively in <strong>Article III</strong>. It outlines specific legislative, social, educational, labor-related, and other measures that states must take to achieve the convention\'s objectives.',
        'States parties are required to eliminate discrimination gradually and promote integration by providing or making available accessible:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>Employment opportunities</li><li>Transportation systems</li><li>Communications infrastructure</li><li>Housing</li><li>Recreation and sports facilities</li><li>Education</li><li>Law enforcement and administration of justice</li><li>Political and administrative activities</li></ul>',
        'These provisions make clear that accessibility is not limited to physical spaces but extends across all areas of public and civic life.'

    {
      heading: 'Implementation approach',
      content: [
        'The convention takes a two-part approach to achieving accessibility. First, it requires states to eliminate architectural, transportation, and communication obstacles to the extent possible. This addresses existing barriers that prevent people with disabilities from accessing buildings, services, and information.',
        'Second, the convention requires that new buildings, vehicles, and facilities be designed to facilitate transportation, communications, and access by persons with disabilities from the start. This forward-looking requirement helps prevent new barriers from being created.',
        'By requiring both the elimination of existing barriers and accessible design for new developments, the convention links non-discrimination with practical accessibility measures. It also allows disability rights issues to be raised before regional human rights bodies, creating accountability and enforcement mechanisms.'
