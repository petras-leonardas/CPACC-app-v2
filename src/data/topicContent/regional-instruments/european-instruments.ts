      content: [
        'The European Convention on Human Rights is a foundational human rights treaty signed in 1950. All Council of Europe member states—nearly all countries in geographical Europe—are party to the convention. The ECHR establishes fundamental civil and political rights for everyone.',
        'While the ECHR does not explicitly list people with disabilities among protected groups, disability is covered under "other status" in its non-discrimination provisions. This means protections against discrimination apply to people with disabilities.',
        'An important feature of the ECHR is that individuals can bring cases directly to the European Court of Human Rights if they believe a state has violated their rights under the convention. This provides a concrete enforcement mechanism for human rights protections.'

        'The European Social Charter was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1961 as a counterpart to the ECHR. While the ECHR focuses on civil and political rights, the ESC guarantees fundamental social and economic rights.',
        'The ESC explicitly addresses disability rights. It grants the right of people with disabilities to independence, social integration, and participation in community life. This makes it one of the earlier international instruments to specifically recognize these rights for disabled people.'

        'The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was adopted in 2000 to bring consistency and clarity to the rights established at different times and in different ways across EU Member States. It brings together the full range of civil, political, economic, and social rights for everyone living in the EU.',
        'The Charter is based on five key sources:<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1"><li>The fundamental rights and freedoms recognized by the European Convention on Human Rights</li><li>The constitutional traditions of EU Member States</li><li>The Council of Europe\'s Social Charter</li><li>The Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers</li><li>Other international conventions to which the EU or its Member States are parties</li></ul>',
        'The Charter became legally binding on EU Member States when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force in December 2009. This means EU institutions and Member States must respect the rights and principles set out in the Charter when implementing EU law.'
