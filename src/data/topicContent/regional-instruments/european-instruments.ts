        'The <strong>European Convention on Human Rights</strong> is a major treaty signed on November 4, 1950. Almost every country in Europe belongs to it. This agreement protects basic freedoms like the right to a fair trial or the right to privacy.',
        'While it doesn\'t specifically use the word "disability" in its main list of protected groups, it includes a phrase called "other status." This means the rules against treating people unfairly apply to people with disabilities, too. If someone\'s rights are ignored, they can take their story directly to the European Court of Human Rights.'

        'This charter was a pioneer. It was one of the first times an international agreement explicitly said that people with disabilities have the right to be independent and play a full part in their community. It focuses on making sure everyone has the support they need to live the life they choose.'
