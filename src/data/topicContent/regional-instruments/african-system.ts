        'The <strong>African Charter on Human and Peoples\' Rights</strong> was adopted in 1981. It is unique because it talks about both the rights an individual has and the responsibilities people have toward their community.',
        'Even though it doesn\'t mention disability in its "anti-discrimination" list, judges and leaders have used this charter to protect people with disabilities for years. It proves that a general rule about fairness can be used to protect anyone, even if they aren\'t named specifically.'

      content: [
        'The <strong>African Disability Rights Protocol</strong> was adopted in 2018 to give more specific protection to people across the continent. This protocol takes global ideas and adds details that are very important for Africa, such as protecting people during armed conflicts or helping those who have had to leave their homes.',
        'One of the most powerful parts of this agreement is how it handles harmful traditions. It explicitly tells governments to stop practices like witchcraft accusations or ritual killings that target people with disabilities. By calling these things out by name, the protocol gives activists a tool to stop violence that used to be hidden. For this agreement to become a "hard rule" for all countries, 15 nations need to sign off on it. As of 2023, it hasn\'t reached that number yet, but it still serves as a great guide for local laws.'
