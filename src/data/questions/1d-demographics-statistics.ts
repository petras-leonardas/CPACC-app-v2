    question: 'Why are disability demographics and statistics collected?',
    options: [
      'They help show the scale and distribution of disability, informing policy, guiding accessibility initiatives, and supporting planning in areas such as health, education, employment, and transportation.',
      'They are gathered mainly to diagnose medical conditions and determine treatment plans.',
      'They are used to classify people into strict eligibility categories for benefits.',
      'They serve primarily as marketing data for commercial product development.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK discussion that demographic data provides context for policy, planning, and accessibility work. The distractors focus on medical diagnosis, narrow eligibility classification, or commercial marketing, none of which capture the purpose of demographic data in the BoK.',

    id: 'q177',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'Why must disability statistics be interpreted within context?',
    options: [
      'Because countries and studies use different definitions, methods, and cultural or legal frameworks, making it essential to understand each dataset’s context before drawing conclusions.',
      'Because disability statistics always follow a universal standard and rarely vary between studies, making context unnecessary for interpretation.',
      'Because statistics focus only on medical diagnoses and do not involve cultural or methodological differences.',
      'Because all disability data is collected exclusively for benefit eligibility and not for broader analysis.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s note that disability statistics vary widely based on definitions, measurement approaches, and cultural or legal environments. The other statements incorrectly claim uniformity, ignore methodological differences, or misstate the purpose of disability data collection.',
    subject: 'Disability demographics and statistics',
  },

    id: 'q178',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'What is a major limitation of disability data in census surveys?',
    options: [
      'Census surveys usually lack detailed information about specific disability types, reducing the accuracy and nuance of the data.',
      'Census surveys always provide highly detailed diagnostic information.',
      'Census surveys focus exclusively on workplace accommodations.',
      'Census surveys intentionally exclude all disability-related questions.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s point that censuses often collect only broad disability information, limiting precision. The distractors describe scenarios that are either false, overly specific, or unrelated to actual census practices.',

  {
    id: 'q179',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'How does differing disability terminology affect global statistics?',
    options: [
      'Terminology varies widely across countries, making cross-country comparisons difficult because conditions may be classified or labeled differently.',
      'Terminology is universally standardized worldwide, so comparisons between countries are always direct and require no adjustment for definitional variation.',
      'Terminology affects only medical diagnoses and does not influence statistical reporting or how conditions are counted in population surveys.',
      'Terminology differences matter only for translation, not for how disability categories are defined, measured, or reported across national datasets.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This reflects the BoK point that inconsistent terminology leads to inconsistent categorization and reduced comparability. The other options incorrectly claim global standardization or downplay the impact of terminology on statistical reporting.',

  },
  {
    id: 'q180',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'Why is counting people with multiple disabilities challenging?',
    options: [
      'Because individuals with more than one disability may not fit neatly into predefined categories, leading to undercounting or misclassification.',
      'Because most data systems automatically classify every disability combination with complete accuracy, using algorithms that account for all possible overlaps and interactions between conditions.',
      'Because multiple disabilities are statistically rare and therefore easy to track consistently across surveys, requiring no special methodological consideration.',
      'Because census surveys always separate each disability type into fully distinct categories, preventing any overlap or misclassification in the resulting data.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK explanation that predefined categories struggle to capture overlapping disabilities. The distractors assume perfect classification, rarity, or detailed census separation—none of which align with real data limitations.',

    question: 'According to the WHO, how many people globally experience significant disability?',
    options: [
      'Approximately 1.3 billion people—about 16% of the world’s population, or roughly 1 in 6 individuals—experience significant disability.',
      'Fewer than 200 million people worldwide experience significant disability.',
      'Nearly half of the global population experiences significant disability.',
      'Only about 2% of the world\'s population experiences significant disability.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This reflects current WHO estimates cited in the BoK. The other options present figures that are far too low or exaggerated and do not align with global data.',

    question: 'What heightened health risks do people with disabilities face according to the WHO?',
    options: [
      'They face about twice the risk of developing conditions such as depression, asthma, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and poor oral health.',
      'They experience slightly lower rates of chronic illness because of increased medical monitoring and more frequent contact with healthcare providers throughout their lives.',
      'They face health risks only in old age, with no elevated risk for younger adults.',
      'They primarily experience acute illnesses rather than chronic conditions.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects WHO data cited in the BoK showing significantly higher rates of chronic health conditions among people with disabilities. The distractors contradict this evidence by claiming lower, age-limited, or non-chronic risk profiles.',

    question: 'How does disability impact life expectancy globally?',
    options: [
      'Some people with disabilities die up to 20 years earlier than people without disabilities.',
      'People with disabilities consistently outlive nondisabled people due to increased medical monitoring and more frequent preventive care throughout their lives.',
      'Disability has no measurable effect on life expectancy according to global studies, with outcomes remaining consistent across populations.',
      'Only people with sensory disabilities experience any change in life expectancy, with all other disability groups showing outcomes comparable to the general population.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects WHO findings cited in the BoK showing significantly reduced life expectancy for many people with disabilities. The other options contradict global evidence by overstating longevity, denying disparities, or limiting the impact to specific disability types.',

    id: 'q184',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'What does the WHO report about accessible transportation?',
    options: [
      'Persons with disabilities find inaccessible and unaffordable transportation 15 times more difficult to use than those without disabilities.',
      'Persons with disabilities experience only slightly more difficulty using transportation compared to nondisabled users, with the gap narrowing as infrastructure improves.',
      'Transportation access is generally equal worldwide, with no measurable differences between disability groups and the broader population.',
      'Accessible transportation primarily benefits nondisabled riders rather than people with disabilities, since universal design features serve the general public more than targeted users.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the WHO statistic cited in the BoK. The other options contradict the reported disparity by minimizing, denying, or misattributing the difficulty in transportation access.',

  {
    id: 'q185',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'What contributes to health inequities for persons with disabilities?',
    options: [
      'Stigma, discrimination, poverty, barriers in education and employment, and inaccessibility within the health system all contribute to health inequities.',
      'Health inequities arise mainly from individual lifestyle choices rather than social or systemic factors, placing responsibility on personal behavior instead of structural barriers.',
      'Health outcomes differ only because disability inherently causes poor health, regardless of external conditions such as poverty, discrimination, or access to services.',
      'Health inequities occur solely due to geographic location and not because of discrimination or access barriers, meaning that region alone determines health disparities.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This option reflects the BoK’s explanation that social, economic, and systemic barriers drive health disparities for persons with disabilities. The other options incorrectly attribute inequities solely to personal choices, inherent disability, or geography, ignoring the broader systemic factors.',

    question: 'How does Eurostat recommend using functional status data?',
    options: [
      'It should be used as a key input for developing public policy in areas such as health, social protection, housing, transportation, culture, education, and employment.',
      'It should be limited to medical research and avoided in broader policy or planning contexts, since functional data lacks the precision needed for public decision-making.',
      'It should be used only for determining eligibility for disability benefits and not for public policy development in areas such as housing, education, or transportation.',
      'It should guide commercial marketing strategies rather than government or social planning, helping businesses identify consumer needs instead of informing public programs.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Eurostat emphasizes functional status data as a foundation for broad policy development across multiple sectors. The distractors incorrectly limit its use to medical research, benefits administration, or commercial marketing, which do not reflect the BoK guidance.',

  },
  {
    id: 'q187',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'What types of questions can disability statistics help answer?',
    options: [
      'They can show how many people have disabilities, reveal age-group patterns, and indicate trends in employment, disposable income, and poverty rates.',
      'They can determine precise medical diagnoses for every individual in a population survey, providing clinical-level detail about each respondent\'s conditions.',
      'They can measure only short-term health conditions and exclude economic or employment data, limiting their usefulness to acute health monitoring.',
      'They can identify commercial buying preferences without providing any demographic insight into population size, age-group patterns, or socioeconomic trends.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Disability statistics support broad social and economic understanding, helping identify population size and patterns across life areas. The distractors incorrectly limit statistics to medical diagnoses, short-term conditions, or unrelated marketing data.',

    id: 'q188',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'Why are disability statistics useful despite known limitations?',
    options: [
      'They help estimate the scale of disability, identify trends, and support planning for interventions even if they are not perfectly precise.',
      'They provide exact diagnostic detail for every disability type without any margin of error, capturing the full clinical picture of each individual in the dataset.',
      'They are primarily collected for marketing purposes rather than public planning or policy, serving commercial interests instead of informing accessibility initiatives.',
      'They eliminate the need for contextual interpretation because all countries use identical methods, definitions, and classification systems when collecting disability data.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s point that disability statistics remain valuable for understanding patterns and guiding policy despite methodological limits. The distractors claim unrealistic precision, misstate the purpose of the data, or ignore the variability in global data collection practices.',

  },
  {
    id: 'q189',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'Why does disability prevalence vary across global reports?',
    options: [
      'Because survey design, disability definitions, national reporting practices, cultural perceptions, and which disability types are included all differ across countries and studies.',
      'Because all nations use identical survey methods, causing little to no variation in reported disability prevalence and making cross-country comparisons straightforward.',
      'Because prevalence depends solely on biological factors and is unaffected by cultural or methodological differences in how disability is defined or measured.',
      'Because only high-income countries collect disability data, making global comparisons impossible and leaving most of the world\'s population unrepresented in prevalence estimates.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This reflects the BoK explanation that methodological and cultural differences make disability prevalence estimates vary widely. The other statements inaccurately claim uniformity, deny methodological influence, or misstate global data collection practices.',

    question: 'What are key sources for disability demographic data?',
    options: [
      'WHO, Eurostat, Statistics Canada, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, UN ESCAP, and the UNH Institute on Disability are major sources of disability demographic data.',
      'Only national tax agencies collect disability demographic data.',
      'Private corporations are the primary international authorities on disability statistics.',
      'Local school districts are responsible for most global disability reporting.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'These organizations are identified in the BoK as leading providers of disability demographic information. The distractors incorrectly attribute global data collection to tax agencies, private corporations, or local school systems, none of which serve this role.',

    id: 'q191',
    topicId: '1d-demographics-statistics',
    question: 'How should accessibility professionals use disability demographics?',
    options: [
      'They should use demographic data as context to advocate for inclusive design, understand diverse user needs, and strengthen business cases for accessibility.',
      'They should rely on demographic data only to categorize users into strict groups.',
      'They should avoid using demographic data in decision-making entirely.',
      'They should use demographic data solely to predict medical diagnoses for users.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK guidance that demographic data informs design decisions, advocacy, and strategic planning. The distractors misuse data for rigid classification, ignore its strategic value, or misinterpret it as medical diagnostic information.',
