    question: 'What are ASD\'s core diagnostic areas?',
    options: [
      'Difficulties in social communication and interaction, along with restricted or repetitive behaviors that may include sensory sensitivities.',
      'Challenges limited to reading fluency and phonological processing without social impact.',
      'Primary deficits in motor coordination and balance that affect physical movement.',
      'Impairments in hearing sensitivity that interfere with interpreting spoken language, describing an auditory disability rather than the social-communication difficulties and sensory sensitivities of ASD.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This reflects the BoK definition of ASD, which identifies social-communication challenges and restricted or repetitive behaviors as core diagnostic features. The distractors describe dyslexia, motor impairments, and auditory disabilities, none of which define ASD.',

    question: 'What common accessibility barriers impact cognitive disabilities?',
    options: [
      'Complex navigation, confusing layouts, time-limited tasks, information overload, difficult forms, and inconsistent interfaces.',
      'Low-contrast text, non-tactile signage, and missing alternative text in visual materials, creating visual access barriers rather than the cognitive overload and confusion that affect people with cognitive disabilities.',
      'Loud environments, lack of captions, and audio-only instructions that require listening skills, creating auditory barriers rather than the information complexity and interface unpredictability that increase cognitive load.',
      'Narrow walkways, steep ramps, and controls placed out of reach for seated users, restricting physical mobility rather than creating the navigational confusion and task complexity that affect cognitive accessibility.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s list of digital and environmental barriers that increase cognitive load. The other options describe visual, auditory, or mobility barriers rather than cognitive accessibility challenges.',

    question: 'What are general accessibility strategies for people with cognitive disabilities?',
    options: [
      'Provide extra time, reduce distractions, use plain language, check comprehension, and offer clear, structured instructions.',
      'Rely primarily on visual cues, complex navigation paths, and dense informational layouts, increasing cognitive demand rather than reducing the barriers that affect comprehension and task completion.',
      'Emphasize rapid task completion, multitasking demands, and minimal explanation, creating time pressure and overload rather than providing the support and clarity that reduce cognitive barriers.',
      'Use audio-only instructions, unpredictable interfaces, and time-limited interactions, introducing confusion and urgency rather than the predictability and extra time that support cognitive accessibility.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option matches the BoK’s recommended strategies for reducing cognitive load and supporting comprehension. The other options introduce complexity, unpredictability, or time pressure, which increase barriers rather than reduce them.',

    question: 'What ICT strategies support cognitive accessibility?',
    options: [
      'Simplified interfaces, multimodal content, personalization options, clear hierarchy, and adequate time to complete tasks.',
      'Dense layouts, rapid task requirements, and constant multitasking demands, increasing cognitive load rather than providing the simplified and flexible experience that supports comprehension.',
      'Interfaces relying solely on audio instructions with unpredictable navigation paths, removing user control and consistency rather than offering the multimodal and structured content that aids cognition.',
      'Highly complex menus, rigid interaction patterns, and limited control over display settings, restricting personalization and adding confusion rather than supporting the clear hierarchy and flexibility that reduce cognitive barriers.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects BoK guidance for reducing cognitive load and supporting comprehension through clarity and flexibility. The other options introduce complexity, unpredictability, or time pressure, which increase cognitive barriers rather than reduce them.',

    options: [
      'Task managers, reminders, prompting tools, audio note-takers, password managers, GPS apps, mindfulness apps, and reading support tools.',
      'Hearing aids, cochlear implants, and sound field systems that enhance auditory perception, supporting sound awareness rather than the organization, memory, and attention needs addressed by cognitive tools.',
      'Screen readers, braille displays, and magnifiers designed primarily for visual access needs, supporting content perception rather than the task management and comprehension functions of cognitive assistive technology.',
      'Wheelchairs, walkers, and alternative input devices focused on mobility assistance, addressing physical movement rather than the attention, memory, and executive functioning challenges of cognitive disabilities.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'These tools match the BoK description of assistive technologies that help with organization, memory, attention, and comprehension for cognitive disabilities. The other options reflect assistive tech for auditory, visual, or mobility needs rather than cognitive functioning.',
