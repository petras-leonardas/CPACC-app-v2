    question: 'What is the purpose of theoretical models of disability?',
    options: [
      'They offer different frameworks for understanding disability, each with strengths and limitations, and none fully comprehensive.',
      'They define one universally correct explanation of disability that applies across all contexts.',
      'They prescribe a single best model that organizations should use for accessibility.',
      'They classify disabilities into medical categories to determine appropriate treatment plans, functioning primarily as a diagnostic tool rather than a conceptual framework.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK description that models provide perspectives, are not fully complete, and are often used in combination. The other options incorrectly claim universal correctness, exclusive use of one model, or a narrow medical-classification purpose.',

    question: 'How does the medical model view disability?',
    options: [
      'It frames disability as a problem within the individual caused by disease or injury that requires medical treatment or cure.',
      'It views disability as primarily the result of social and environmental barriers.',
      'It treats disability as a cultural identity defined by group membership.',
      'It interprets disability mainly through its economic impact on productivity and employment, measuring limitation in terms of workforce participation and financial outcomes.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This aligns with the medical model, which locates disability in the individual and focuses on treatment or cure. The other options describe the social model, cultural identity model, and economic model, which are based on different assumptions.',

    id: 'q103',
    topicId: '1a-theoretical-models',
    question: 'What is a primary strength of the medical model?',
    options: [
      'It can address the biological causes of disability and provide medical treatments or management strategies when needed.',
      'It ensures that disability is understood entirely as a product of environmental barriers.',
      'It prioritizes cultural identity and community belonging as the main lens.',
      'It focuses on economic productivity to determine the level of disability support required, measuring an individual\'s value primarily through their capacity to contribute to the workforce.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This matches the BoK description that the medical model’s strength is its ability to address underlying biological conditions. The other options describe the social model, cultural affiliation model, and economic model, which reflect different purposes and assumptions.',

    question: 'What is a major weakness of the medical model?',
    options: [
      'It treats disability as an individual problem and often overlooks how societal and environmental barriers contribute to disabling conditions.',
      'It assumes disability results only from social attitudes and excludes any consideration of medical needs, dismissing biological factors as irrelevant to the disability experience.',
      'It overemphasizes personal identity and group culture as the primary explanation for disability, reducing complex experiences to questions of community belonging.',
      'It fails to recognize economic impacts and therefore avoids discussions of support or accommodations, leaving financial consequences unaddressed in its analysis of disability.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK’s description that the medical model centers disability within the individual and neglects environmental and sociopolitical factors. The other options describe weaknesses of the social model, cultural affiliation model, and economic model rather than the medical model.',

    question: 'What does the social model of disability emphasize?',
    options: [
      'It explains disability as the result of societal and environmental barriers rather than the person’s impairment, highlighting the need to remove barriers for full participation.',
      'It views disability as a medical condition that must be treated or cured through clinical intervention, placing responsibility on healthcare systems to resolve impairment.',
      'It defines disability primarily by an individual\'s economic productivity and work limitations, measuring the impact of impairment through labor market participation.',
      'It bases disability identity on cultural affiliation and belonging to a specific community, treating group membership as the defining feature of the disability experience.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,

      'It supports coordinated interventions that address both medical and social factors, making it especially effective in rehabilitation contexts.',
      'It eliminates the need for medical input by focusing solely on environmental barriers.',
      'It provides a single standardized definition based only on economic productivity.',
      'It replaces the need for interdisciplinary teams by centering treatment entirely on psychological factors, assuming that mental health interventions alone are sufficient for all cases.',

    options: [
      'Critics argue it may downplay medical needs and is complex to implement, creating challenges for consistent application.',
      'It dismisses the role of social barriers entirely and treats disability solely as a biological condition, reverting to a purely medical understanding of impairment and limitation.',
      'It removes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration by prioritizing economic assessments, evaluating disability only through its impact on productivity and financial costs.',
      'It assumes disability is primarily a cultural identity and overlooks functional or medical factors, reducing the experience to group belonging without acknowledging bodily realities.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects concerns noted in the BoK: that the ICF’s integration of social and medical factors may underemphasize medical needs and is difficult to apply due to its complexity.

    question: 'What are the strengths and limitations of the economic model?',
    options: [
      'It notes that disability may require financial support or workplace accommodations, but it can also stigmatize people by defining strict eligibility categories.',
      'It argues that disability is created only by social barriers and treats economic impacts as irrelevant, dismissing financial consequences as outside the scope of disability analysis.',
      'It focuses on disability mainly as a cultural identity shared within specific communities, emphasizing group pride and belonging over economic or functional considerations.',
