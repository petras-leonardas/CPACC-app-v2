    question: 'What is disability etiquette?',
    options: [
      'It is a set of guidelines for interacting with and communicating about people with disabilities in a respectful, inclusive manner, including appropriate behavior, attitudes, and language.',
      'It is a formal medical protocol used by clinicians to diagnose disabilities during evaluations.',
      'It is a collection of legal requirements that determine eligibility for disability benefits.',
      'It is a marketing strategy to promote disability-related products and services.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement aligns with the BoK description of disability etiquette as respectful interaction and communication practices. The distractors incorrectly frame it as medical protocol, legal eligibility criteria, or marketing strategy, none of which reflect its purpose.',

  {
    id: 'q193',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'How should you address a person with a disability during interactions?',
    options: [
      'Speak directly to the person rather than to an accompanying friend, family member, or interpreter.',
      'Direct your questions to whoever is assisting them to avoid causing discomfort, since intermediaries are generally better positioned to interpret needs and relay information on behalf of the individual during conversations.',
      'Wait for a third party to introduce the person before speaking, as direct conversation without a prior introduction may come across as presumptuous or socially inappropriate.',
      'Speak only to an interpreter to ensure the message is communicated accurately and completely.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Disability etiquette emphasizes addressing the individual directly to demonstrate respect and autonomy. The distractors shift communication to others, which undermines direct interaction and is inconsistent with inclusive etiquette practices.',
    subject: 'Disability etiquette',
  },
  {
    id: 'q194',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'What is the guideline related to assumptions about abilities?',
    options: [
      'Avoid making assumptions about what a person can or cannot do, since disability affects each individual differently.',
      'Assume that most people with disabilities require the same type of assistance, as this simplifies interactions and ensures a consistent approach.',
      'Rely on visible cues alone to determine a person\'s abilities, since observable indicators usually provide a reliable basis for judgment.',
      'Presume that offering unsolicited help is always the appropriate response, as proactive support signals care and attentiveness.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Disability etiquette emphasizes not assuming ability levels and recognizing individual variation. The distractors all encourage assuming needs or offering help without consent, which contradicts respectful interaction principles.',
    subject: 'Disability etiquette',
  },
  {
    id: 'q195',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'When should you offer assistance to someone with a disability?',
    options: [
      'Offer help only when the person requests it or after asking their permission, rather than assuming assistance is needed.',
      'Offer help automatically whenever you notice a person with a disability nearby, since proactive assistance demonstrates awareness and consideration regardless of whether the individual has indicated they need support.',
      'Provide assistance only if a companion explicitly asks on their behalf.',
      'Avoid offering help unless you are formally trained in disability support.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This reflects etiquette guidance that assistance should be consensual and not imposed. The distractors endorse automatic help, third-party permission, or withholding assistance entirely, none of which align with respectful interaction practices.',

  {
    id: 'q196',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'What is the etiquette guideline regarding a person’s decision-making?',
    options: [
      'Acknowledge and respect the person’s ability to make their own decisions and judgments.',
      'Make decisions for the person whenever possible to help streamline the interaction and avoid unnecessary delays, particularly in fast-paced or time-sensitive environments where efficiency is prioritized.',
      'Defer all decisions to a companion or support person.',
      'Assume the person cannot make independent choices unless told otherwise.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Disability etiquette emphasizes autonomy and respecting each person’s right to make their own choices. The distractors undermine independence by assuming incapacity or directing decisions to others.',

  },
  {
    id: 'q197',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'What should you avoid touching without permission?',
    options: [
      'A person’s wheelchair, mobility device, or other equipment, since these items are part of their personal space.',
      'Any furniture or surrounding objects near the person, because all items within close proximity are considered extensions of personal space.',
      'Only electronic devices such as phones or tablets, while mobility equipment like wheelchairs and canes is generally acceptable to reposition.',
      'Clothing items and personal belongings only, since mobility devices and assistive equipment can be handled freely if doing so appears helpful.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This follows the etiquette guideline that mobility devices function as extensions of a person’s body and should not be touched without consent. The distractors either overgeneralize, contradict etiquette, or imply permission where none exists.',

  {
    id: 'q198',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'What is people-first language and why is it recommended?',
    options: [
      'It places the person before the disability (e.g., “person with a disability”) to avoid labeling and stigmatization and aligns with conventions such as the UN CRPD.',
      'It emphasizes disability first in all descriptions to highlight the primary identity.',
      'It replaces all disability-related terminology with formal medical diagnoses.',
      'It discourages mentioning disability entirely to avoid drawing attention to differences.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This reflects the BoK’s explanation that people-first language centers the individual and reduces stigma. The other options promote disability-first labeling, medicalization, or avoidance, none of which align with recommended etiquette.',
    subject: 'Disability etiquette',
  },
  {
    id: 'q199',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'What is identity-first language and when should it be used?',
    options: [
      'It emphasizes disability as a core part of identity (e.g., “disabled person”) and should be used when individuals or communities indicate this is their preferred terminology.',
      'It labels disability before the person in all situations regardless of preference.',
      'It is recommended only in clinical settings to highlight diagnostic categories.',
      'It replaces people-first language entirely because it is universally preferred.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK explanation that identity-first language is appropriate when chosen by the individual or community. The other options ignore personal preference, misuse clinical framing, or claim universal preference, none of which align with recommended etiquette.',
    subject: 'Disability etiquette',
  },
  {
    id: 'q200',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'What is the general principle for choosing inclusive language?',
    options: [
      'Use respectful, non-stigmatizing language and follow the preferences of the individual or community being referenced.',
      'Apply people-first or identity-first language uniformly without considering individual preference, ensuring consistency across all communication.',
      'Avoid mentioning disability entirely in both verbal and written communication to prevent drawing attention to perceived differences.',
      'Choose terminology based solely on organizational policy and style guides rather than factoring in the preferences of users or communities.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This reflects the BoK’s guidance that respectful language and honoring personal preference are central to inclusive communication. The other options either enforce uniform terminology, erase disability, or ignore user preference—contradicting inclusive language principles.',
    subject: 'Disability etiquette',
  },
  {
    id: 'q201',
    topicId: '1e-disability-etiquette',
    question: 'What is the overarching goal of disability etiquette?',
    options: [
      'To foster respectful, barrier-free interactions and communication that support inclusion and dignity for people with disabilities.',
      'To ensure all interactions follow strict medical guidelines for classifying disabilities.',
      'To formalize legal requirements for benefit eligibility during social interactions.',
      'To minimize conversation with people with disabilities to avoid discomfort.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'This captures the BoK’s emphasis on respect, inclusion, and removing interaction barriers. The other options incorrectly focus on medical diagnosis, legal determination, or avoidance—none of which reflect the purpose of disability etiquette.',
