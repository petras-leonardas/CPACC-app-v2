    question: 'How does accessibility support full participation in society?',
    options: [
      'It removes barriers so people with disabilities can participate equally in education, employment, and social life.',
      'It focuses mainly on providing specialized services rather than enabling participation.',
      'It limits participation to specific settings where accommodations have been formally approved.',
      'It supports inclusion primarily through individual assistance rather than changes to environments.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK’s emphasis that accessibility enables equal participation across major life domains by removing barriers. The other options narrow accessibility to services, restricted contexts, or individual assistance rather than broad societal inclusion.',

    topicId: '2b-benefits-accessibility',
    question: 'How does accessibility influence health and overall well-being?',
    options: [
      'By enabling participation in daily, social, and community activities, accessibility supports better health, independence, and personal well-being.',
      'By focusing primarily on medical treatment and clinical intervention, accessibility directly improves physical health outcomes while leaving broader social and community participation as a secondary consideration.',
      'By limiting activities to controlled environments, accessibility reduces health risks and social exposure.',
      'By relying on individual assistance rather than inclusive design, accessibility minimizes the need for independent participation.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK’s emphasis that accessibility supports health and well-being through participation, autonomy, and inclusion. The other options incorrectly frame accessibility as medical treatment, restriction, or dependence rather than enabling full engagement in life activities.',

    topicId: '2b-benefits-accessibility',
    question: 'How do families benefit when accessibility is improved?',
    options: [
      'Families gain greater independence for their loved ones, experience reduced caregiving burden, and see improved quality of life for everyone in the household.',
      'Families become solely responsible for providing accommodations within the home and surrounding community, with limited support from external organizations.',
      'Families benefit only in formal workplace settings, with little measurable impact on daily home routines, social participation, or community involvement.',
      'Families rely more heavily on external support services rather than benefiting from increased independence, shifting caregiving responsibilities to specialized providers.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s explanation that accessibility supports independence and reduces strain on families. The other options either increase burden, limit benefits to narrow contexts, or contradict the goal of accessibility by emphasizing dependence.',

    topicId: '2b-benefits-accessibility',
    question: 'How does accessibility improve innovation within organizations?',
    options: [
      'By including people with diverse abilities, organizations gain varied perspectives that foster creativity, stronger problem-solving, and more innovative solutions.',
      'By limiting participation to standardized processes and uniform workflows, organizations reduce variation and maintain consistent outcomes, ensuring that all contributions follow established procedures and expectations.',
      'By focusing innovation efforts only on meeting compliance requirements and regulatory benchmarks, organizations avoid unnecessary experimentation and allocate resources toward predictable, low-risk improvements.',
      'By centralizing decision-making among a small group of specialists, organizations streamline ideas and reduce complexity, maintaining control over direction while limiting the influence of diverse viewpoints.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK principle that diversity and inclusion drive innovation through broader perspectives and ideas. The other options emphasize restriction, minimal compliance, or limited participation, which undermine creativity and collaborative problem-solving.',

    question: 'Why is accessibility good for business and organizations?',
    options: [
      'It expands reach to more customers and employees, reduces reliance on costly individual accommodations, and improves overall usability and operational efficiency.',
      'It mainly benefits a small subset of users while increasing costs and slowing down product development cycles, creating overhead that outweighs any potential gains in customer reach or employee satisfaction.',
      'It focuses on meeting minimum legal requirements without offering broader organizational or market advantages.',
      'It shifts responsibility for access to individual users rather than improving systems, processes, or products.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK view that accessibility delivers broad business value through reach, efficiency, and better design. The other options minimize benefits, frame accessibility as compliance-only, or misrepresent it as shifting burden rather than improving systems.',

    question: 'How does society benefit from accessibility?',
    options: [
      'Society benefits through greater participation, higher productivity, stronger social inclusion, and reduced long-term support costs as more people can contribute independently.',
      'Society benefits mainly through charitable support systems and donor-funded programs rather than by enabling independent participation in everyday civic and economic life.',
      'Accessibility benefits only a small group of people with specific conditions and has minimal measurable impact on overall economic, social, or community-level outcomes.',
      'Society benefits by shifting responsibility for access onto individuals and their families instead of investing in inclusive public environments, systems, and infrastructure.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s emphasis that accessibility enables broader participation and independence, benefiting society socially and economically. The other options minimize accessibility’s impact, frame it as charity-based, or misrepresent it as shifting responsibility rather than enabling inclusion.',

    question: 'What is the macro-level economic impact of excluding people with disabilities?',
    options: [
      'Excluding people with disabilities from the labor market contributes to measurable global GDP losses, showing that accessibility is an economic as well as a social imperative.',
      'Exclusion has little economic effect because disability participation does not significantly influence productivity.',
      'Economic impacts are limited to short-term accommodation costs rather than long-term productivity.',
      'Excluding people with disabilities primarily affects social programs and charitable funding.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s position that exclusion results in significant lost economic output at a global scale. The other options minimize or deny the documented links between accessibility, labor participation, and macroeconomic outcomes.',

    question: 'How does accessibility improve the built and digital world for everyone?',
    options: [
      'It enhances overall usability through features like clearer signage, better navigation, captions, curb cuts, and cleaner digital interfaces that benefit all users.',
      'It mainly supports people with disabilities while offering limited or incidental benefit to other users, since accessibility features are designed for specific functional needs rather than general usability improvement.',
      'It prioritizes specialized tools over general usability, often making spaces more complex for the average user.',
      'It improves access only in regulated settings, with little effect on daily digital or physical interactions.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK principle that accessibility features often improve usability for everyone, not only people with disabilities. The other options minimize accessibility’s broad benefits or mischaracterize it as specialized, complex, or narrowly applied.',

    question: 'How does accessibility contribute to diversity and inclusion?',
    options: [
      'By including people with disabilities, organizations gain broader perspectives, richer cultural representation, and stronger engagement across teams and communities.',
      'By focusing primarily on compliance requirements and regulatory checklists, accessibility ensures consistent treatment across the organization without significantly affecting team dynamics, cultural representation, or engagement.',
      'By limiting participation to standardized roles, accessibility reduces variation and simplifies inclusion efforts.',
      'By addressing only physical access needs, accessibility supports inclusion without influencing viewpoints or representation.'
