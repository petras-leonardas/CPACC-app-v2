    question: 'What is the purpose of Perceptible Information?',
    options: [
      'To ensure essential information is communicated effectively to all users, regardless of sensory ability, by using multiple modes, sufficient contrast, clear differentiation, and compatibility with assistive technologies.',
      'To prioritize visual presentation so information is delivered primarily through text, color, and graphics, assuming that visual channels are sufficient for most users in most contexts.',
      'To simplify content by reducing the amount of information presented, even if important details are omitted in the process of making the interface less cluttered.',
      'To rely on a single sensory channel at a time so users are not overwhelmed by multiple simultaneous forms of information competing for attention.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the Perceptible Information principle, which requires information to be available through different sensory channels and usable with assistive devices. The other options emphasize visual-only delivery, loss of essential information, or reliance on a single sensory mode, all of which conflict with this principle.',

    topicId: '2e-universal-design-principles',
    question: 'What does Tolerance for Error aim to reduce?',
    options: [
      'It aims to reduce hazards and unintended actions by minimizing errors, providing warnings, incorporating fail-safe features, and discouraging unconscious actions in critical tasks.',
      'It aims to eliminate all user errors by restricting interaction options and requiring strict procedural compliance, limiting what users can do to prevent any deviation from intended workflows.',
      'It focuses on increasing efficiency by allowing users to recover from mistakes only after tasks are completed, deferring error correction to a separate review stage.',
      'It emphasizes training users to avoid mistakes rather than designing systems that prevent or mitigate errors, placing responsibility on user behavior instead of system design.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the principle’s focus on preventing harm and reducing the consequences of mistakes through design. The other options rely on restriction, delayed recovery, or user training instead of proactive, error-tolerant design.',

    id: 'q261',
    topicId: '2e-universal-design-principles',
    question: 'What overarching goals guide universal design?',
    options: [
      'To promote inclusive access, reduce the need for later accommodations, and improve usability and convenience for all users by addressing diverse needs from the start.',
      'To ensure compliance with accessibility laws while allowing individual accommodations to address most user needs after implementation, treating legal requirements as the ceiling rather than the floor for inclusive design.',
      'To design primarily for the average user and rely on specialized adaptations when people encounter barriers, addressing diversity through reactive measures rather than proactive planning.',
      'To focus on efficiency and cost savings by limiting design considerations to the most common use cases, assuming that edge cases can be addressed through separate accommodations later.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s emphasis on proactive, inclusive design that benefits everyone and minimizes later retrofits. The other options prioritize compliance-only approaches, average-user assumptions, or narrow efficiency goals rather than broad inclusion.',
    subject: 'Additional context and goals of universal design',

  {
    id: 'q262',
    topicId: '2e-universal-design-principles',
    question: 'How does universal design differ from accommodations?',
    options: [
      'Universal design builds inclusive usability into the initial design for everyone, while accommodations are individual modifications made when the main design does not meet specific needs.',
      'Universal design focuses on personal adjustments requested by individuals, while accommodations aim to improve usability for the widest range of users through proactive, system-level changes.',
      'Universal design and accommodations are interchangeable approaches that are applied at the same stage of design and implementation, differing only in name.',
      'Accommodations prevent access barriers from occurring through early inclusive planning, while universal design responds after barriers are identified in real use.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK distinction between proactive, inclusive design and reactive, person-specific adjustments. The other options reverse the concepts, treat them as interchangeable, or misrepresent which approach prevents versus responds to barriers.',
