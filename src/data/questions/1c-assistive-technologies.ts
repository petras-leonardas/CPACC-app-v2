    question: 'What are assistive technologies according to the CPACC BoK?',
    options: [
      'They are products, devices, or systems—digital or not—that help people with disabilities perform tasks they otherwise could not do.',
      'They are only high-tech digital tools designed to replace human assistance entirely.',
      'They are medical treatments intended to cure or reverse impairments.',
      'They are workplace tools used solely to measure productivity and job performance, serving an administrative function rather than enabling individuals to complete tasks independently.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK definition, which includes both computer-based and non-digital tools that support functional access. The other statements incorrectly limit assistive tech to high-tech tools, medical treatments, or productivity systems.',

    id: 'q157',
    topicId: '1c-assistive-technologies',
    question: 'What are adaptive strategies?',
    options: [
      'They are personalized adjustments people with disabilities use to complete tasks, such as modifying settings, breaking tasks into steps, or changing positioning to improve access.',
      'They are standardized medical treatments designed to restore full functional ability.',
      'They are high-tech assistive devices that replace the need for individual problem-solving.',
      'They are workplace policies used solely to measure productivity and performance, functioning as organizational tools rather than personal approaches to overcoming barriers.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Adaptive strategies are user-driven, individualized approaches to accomplishing tasks. The distractors refer to medical treatments, high-tech devices, or workplace productivity measures, none of which describe adaptive strategies.',

    topicId: '1c-assistive-technologies',
    question: 'How does accessibility differ from assistive technology?',
    options: [
      'Accessibility is the responsibility of designers to ensure environments and products are usable by everyone, while assistive technologies are tools individuals use when they need additional or personalized support.',
      'Accessibility and assistive technology are both individualized tools used only when universal design is not possible, serving as fallback options rather than distinct concepts with different roles.',
      'Accessibility refers to medical treatments used to restore function, while assistive technologies are workplace accommodations provided by employers to meet compliance requirements.',
      'Accessibility is optional design enhancement, whereas assistive technology replaces the need for accessible products by compensating for any barriers that exist in the environment.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK distinction: accessibility is built into products and environments, whereas assistive technologies support individual needs. The other options confuse medical treatment, workplace accommodation, or imply that accessibility is optional or identical to assistive tech.',
