    question: 'What is the overall purpose of international disability-related declarations and conventions?',
    options: [
      'They establish global human rights principles, set expectations for equal treatment, and guide countries in developing laws and policies that protect the rights and dignity of people with disabilities.',
      'They provide nonbinding recommendations focused mainly on charitable support rather than enforceable rights.',
      'They standardize medical definitions of disability so countries can diagnose impairments consistently.',
      'They replace national laws by creating a single international legal system governing disability services.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK purpose of international declarations and conventions as rights-based frameworks guiding national policy and legal development.

    question: 'What is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)?',
    options: [
      'Adopted in 1948, it is a foundational human rights declaration affirming equal rights and freedoms for all people and shaping later disability-specific conventions.',
      'It is a disability-specific treaty that legally enforces accessibility standards across all United Nations member states, requiring compliance through binding technical specifications.',
      'It is a medical framework developed to classify impairments and define eligibility for disability benefits worldwide.',
      'It is a regional policy agreement focused primarily on employment rights for people with disabilities.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK description of the UDHR as a foundational human rights instrument that influenced later disability rights frameworks.

    id: 'q278',
    topicId: '3a-international-conventions',
    question: 'How does the UDHR influence disability rights?',
    options: [
      'It establishes core principles like equality, dignity, and freedom from discrimination that later disability rights frameworks, such as the CRPD, are built upon.',
      'It directly defines disability categories and prescribes specific accessibility standards that all countries must adopt without modification or adaptation to local legal traditions and regulatory contexts.',
      'It focuses primarily on medical treatment obligations for people with disabilities rather than rights or equality.',
      'It replaces the need for disability-specific conventions by addressing all disability issues in sufficient detail to make subsequent international agreements unnecessary.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK explanation that the UDHR provides foundational human rights principles later applied to disability-specific instruments. The other options incorrectly claim the UDHR is disability-specific, medical in focus, or sufficient on its own without later conventions.',

    topicId: '3a-international-conventions',
    question: 'What key shift does the CRPD emphasize in how disability is understood?',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The CRPD requires ratifying states to actively protect rights, ensure accessibility, and promote inclusion through legal and policy measures.
