    question: 'What is the fundamental difference between individualized accommodations and universal design?',
    options: [
      'Individual accommodations address specific needs after barriers occur, while universal design aims to prevent barriers by creating environments usable by many people from the start.',
      'Universal design focuses on broad usability across diverse populations, whereas individualized accommodations provide tailored adjustments when general solutions are insufficient.',
      'Individual accommodations and universal design both address accessibility challenges in equivalent ways, so organizations can apply either approach interchangeably.',
      'Universal design replaces personalized adjustments entirely by ensuring all users are automatically supported, even when distinct functional needs vary widely among individuals.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK distinction between reactive, person-specific accommodations and proactive, inclusive universal design. The other options either invert the relationship, claim the two approaches are interchangeable, or overstate universal design’s ability to eliminate the need for accommodations.',

    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'What is the purpose of individualized accommodations?',
    options: [
      'They compensate for gaps in an existing design by providing specific adjustments so an individual can access what others already can.',
      'They proactively design environments and systems to work for the widest possible range of people from the beginning, without requiring later modifications or person-specific changes.',
      'They standardize accessibility by applying identical modifications to all users regardless of individual needs or context, ensuring uniform support through a single consistent approach.',
      'They replace the need for inclusive design by relying on general organizational policies and broad compliance measures rather than providing person-specific solutions to access barriers.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK explanation that accommodations are reactive, person-specific solutions addressing design shortcomings. The other options describe universal design, mischaracterize accommodations as one-size-fits-all, or incorrectly suggest they replace inclusive design.',

    id: 'q204',
    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'What are key limitations of individualized accommodations?',
    options: [
      'They are reactive and person-specific, can cause delays or stigma, and often place the responsibility on the individual to request support.',
      'They proactively remove barriers for everyone and eliminate the need for inclusive design practices across organizations, ensuring equal access without requiring individual disclosure or requests.',
      'They ensure equal access automatically without requiring disclosure, requests, or changes to existing systems.',
      'They apply broadly to all users at once, reducing the need for design updates or policy reviews.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK’s critique that individualized accommodations are reactive, limited in scope, and can shift burden onto the person needing access. The other options incorrectly describe proactive, universal, or burden-free approaches that align more with universal design than accommodations.',

    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'What is the goal of universal design (UD)?',
    options: [
      'It aims to create products, services, and environments usable by the widest possible range of people from the outset, reducing or eliminating the need for later accommodations.',
      'It focuses on providing individualized adjustments after barriers are identified.',
      'It standardizes one optimal design solution that works best for an average user.',
      'It prioritizes compliance with minimum legal accessibility requirements rather than broad usability.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK definition of universal design as proactive and inclusive from the start. The other options describe reactive accommodations, one-size-fits-all design, or minimum compliance approaches rather than universal design principles.',

    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'What is an example of an individualized accommodation?',
    options: [
      'Providing a screen reader to a blind employee or arranging CART captioning for a Deaf or hard-of-hearing participant.',
      'Designing a website from the start so it works equally well with keyboard, mouse, or touch input, ensuring that all users can navigate and interact with content regardless of their preferred method.',
      'Installing automatic doors and level entrances so all visitors can enter a building independently.',
      'Creating a single standard interface intended to meet the needs of an average user across all contexts.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option describes person-specific supports added to address access barriers after the main design is in place. The others describe universal design features or generalized approaches rather than individualized accommodations.',

    question: 'What is an example of universal design in ICT or the built environment?',
    options: [
      'Features such as curb cuts, wide entrances, captioned videos by default, or adjustable font sizes that benefit many users, not only people with disabilities.',
      'Providing a screen reader only after an employee formally requests one as a workplace accommodation through human resources.',
      'Offering captioning solely for individuals who formally disclose a hearing disability and submit documentation supporting their access needs.',
      'Modifying a single workspace after construction to meet one person’s specific needs rather than designing inclusively from the beginning.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects universal design by embedding accessibility features from the start that serve a wide range of users. The other options describe reactive, individual accommodations rather than proactive, inclusive design.',

    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'Who benefits from universal design?',
    options: [
      'Everyone benefits, including people with permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities, because universal design anticipates varied needs and reduces barriers for all users.',
      'Only people with permanent disabilities benefit, since universal design is intended exclusively for long-term impairments.',
      'Primarily designers and organizations benefit from reduced future redesign costs.',
      'Only users who formally request accommodations benefit, because universal design depends on individual disclosure.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK principle that universal design improves usability for a wide range of users and situations. The other options incorrectly limit benefits to specific groups, organizations, or accommodation requests rather than broad, inclusive use.',

    id: 'q209',
    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'Do individualized accommodations still matter when universal design is in place?',
    options: [
      'Yes, because even with universal design, some people will still need individualized support based on specific needs or contexts.',
      'No, because universal design fully removes the need for any individual adjustments in all situations by anticipating and addressing every possible access requirement during the initial design process.',
      'Only during early design phases, since accommodations become unnecessary once universal design has been fully implemented.',
      'Only for legal compliance purposes, since universal design addresses usability but not formal access requirements.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK position that universal design reduces barriers broadly but cannot meet every individual need. The other options incorrectly claim universal design is sufficient in all cases, limit accommodations to timing or compliance, or deny ongoing individualized needs.',

  },
  {
    id: 'q210',
    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'How does timing differ between accommodations and universal design?',
    options: [
      'Accommodations are implemented after a barrier is encountered, while universal design is integrated early to prevent barriers before use.',
      'Accommodations and universal design are both applied only after users report access problems during use.',
      'Universal design is added after launch as a retrofit, whereas accommodations are planned during initial design phases.',
      'Accommodations are built into products from the start, while universal design is applied only when specific issues arise.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK distinction that accommodations are reactive and universal design is proactive. The other options reverse the timing, treat both approaches as reactive, or incorrectly assign proactive planning to accommodations.',

    topicId: '2a-accommodations-universal-design',
    question: 'Which approach aligns more closely with accessibility and inclusion principles?',
    options: [
      'Universal design, because it embeds accessibility into environments and products from the start and reduces reliance on individual retrofits.',
      'Individual accommodations, because they customize access for each person after barriers are identified in real use, allowing organizations to address specific functional needs through targeted, person-centered adjustments.',
      'Legal compliance approaches, because meeting minimum regulatory requirements is sufficient to ensure inclusion for all users.',
      'Reactive design updates, because accessibility improvements are most effective when informed by problems reported during actual use.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK principle that universal design proactively supports inclusion by minimizing barriers for the widest range of users. The other options emphasize reactive, minimum, or person-specific approaches that do not align as closely with inclusive design principles.',
