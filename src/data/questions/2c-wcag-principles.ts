    question: 'Why are text alternatives required for non-text content?',
    options: [
      'They ensure information can be conveyed through assistive technologies like screen readers and other non-visual interfaces.',
      'They improve visual layout consistency and branding across different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that non-text elements display uniformly regardless of platform.',
      'They allow decorative images to load faster without affecting user understanding.',
      'They replace the need for captions, transcripts, or other accessibility features, assuming that a single text alternative is sufficient to cover all accessibility requirements for multimedia content.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the WCAG requirement that non-text content must have text alternatives so information is accessible through assistive technologies.

    question: 'What alternatives must be provided for multimedia?',
    options: [
      'Captions and other alternatives must be provided so users can access both audio and visual information in different ways.',
      'Multimedia should rely primarily on audio playback, with visual elements considered optional.',
      'Providing transcripts alone is sufficient, even when users need synchronized access.',
      'Alternatives are required only when multimedia content is educational and not for general use.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects WCAG guidance that multimedia requires captions and other alternatives to ensure access to audio and visual content. The other options incorrectly limit when alternatives are needed or suggest incomplete or optional access methods.',

    id: 'q228',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'Why must content be adaptable?',
    options: [
      'So it can be presented in different formats without losing meaning, supporting assistive technologies and individual user preferences.',
      'So content appearance remains fixed across devices, ensuring consistent visual presentation for all users regardless of their assistive technology or display settings.',
      'So designers can limit content to a single layout for the majority of users.',
      'So content can be rearranged freely even if structure and meaning change.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the WCAG requirement that content remain meaningful when adapted for different presentations or technologies. The other options either prioritize fixed presentation, majority-only design, or allow loss of structure and meaning, which contradicts accessibility principles.',

  },
  {
    id: 'q230',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'Why must all functionality be keyboard accessible?',
    options: [
      'Because many users rely on keyboards, switch devices, or screen readers and cannot use a mouse to interact with content.',
      'Because keyboard interaction is faster and more efficient for all users than mouse or touch input, making it the preferred method for general web navigation.',
      'Because accessibility standards require keyboard use even when alternatives work well.',
      'Because keyboard-only interaction simplifies interface design by eliminating other inputs.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the WCAG requirement that interfaces support non-mouse input used by many people with disabilities. The other options incorrectly frame keyboard access as a preference, a simplification strategy, or an arbitrary requirement rather than an essential accessibility need.',

  {
    id: 'q231',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'Why is giving users enough time important?',
    options: [
      'Because users with cognitive, motor, or sensory disabilities may need additional time to read, process information, or complete interactions.',
      'Because longer time limits improve content quality and visual presentation.',
      'Because time limits are mainly a technical constraint rather than an accessibility concern.',
      'Because removing time limits ensures all users complete tasks at the same pace, treating uniform speed as the goal rather than accommodating diverse processing and interaction needs.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects WCAG guidance that adequate time supports users who process information or interact at different speeds. The other options mischaracterize time limits as aesthetic, technical-only, or about enforcing uniform pacing rather than accessibility.',

    id: 'q233',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'How does WCAG support easier navigation?',
    options: [
      'By requiring mechanisms such as headings, landmarks, and skip links that help users locate and move through content efficiently.',
      'By limiting navigation options so users follow a single, fixed path.',
      'By prioritizing visual menus and mouse-based navigation over alternatives.',
      'By relying on user familiarity with page layouts rather than providing navigation aids.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects WCAG requirements that provide structural and navigational aids to support efficient movement through content. The other options restrict navigation, favor specific input methods, or assume prior knowledge instead of supporting accessible navigation.',

    id: 'q235',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'Why must text be readable and understandable?',
    options: [
      'Because clear, plain language reduces barriers for people with cognitive, language, or learning disabilities and supports broader comprehension.',
      'Because complex language increases precision and encourages users to engage more deeply with content, rewarding careful reading with greater understanding.',
      'Because readability requirements apply only to educational materials and not to general web content, limiting plain-language obligations to instructional contexts.',
      'Because technical or dense wording helps ensure content is interpreted consistently by all users, reducing ambiguity through specialized terminology and formal phrasing.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects WCAG guidance that understandable text reduces cognitive and language barriers. The other options incorrectly promote complexity, limit applicability, or assume dense language improves accessibility.',

    question: 'What does WCAG require for predictable navigation and behavior?',
    options: [
      'Interfaces must behave in consistent and predictable ways so users are not confused by unexpected changes.',
      'Interfaces should frequently change navigation patterns to keep users engaged and attentive, using variation as a strategy for maintaining interest.',
      'Navigation behavior may vary widely as long as visual design remains consistent across pages, treating appearance as a substitute for behavioral predictability.',
      'Predictability applies only to advanced users who have time to learn changing interface behavior, while new users are expected to adapt through repeated use.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the WCAG requirement that consistent behavior helps users understand and navigate interfaces reliably. The other options promote inconsistency, limit predictability to visuals only, or assume users should adapt to changing behavior, which conflicts with accessibility principles.',
    subject: 'Understandable',
  },
  {
    id: 'q237',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'How does WCAG help users avoid and correct mistakes?',
    options: [
      'By requiring clear instructions, helpful error messages, and opportunities to review, correct, or reverse inputs before final submission.',
      'By preventing users from making any input errors through strict system constraints and limited interaction choices, removing the possibility of mistakes by restricting what users can do.',
      'By allowing errors to occur without feedback so users can learn through trial and repetition, treating mistakes as part of the natural learning process.',
      'By shifting responsibility for error detection entirely to assistive technologies rather than interface design, assuming that external tools will identify and correct user mistakes.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects WCAG requirements that support error prevention and recovery through guidance and feedback. The other options either remove user control, withhold necessary feedback, or incorrectly delegate responsibility away from accessible interface design.',

  {
    id: 'q238',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'What does “Robust” mean in WCAG?',
    options: [
      'Content must be compatible with current and future assistive technologies and user agents so it remains accessible as technology evolves.',
      'Content must rely on the newest web technologies to ensure advanced functionality and modern design patterns, keeping pace with industry trends regardless of backward compatibility.',
      'Content must be visually rich and interactive to support engagement across different platforms and devices, using dynamic media as the primary means of communication.',
      'Content must function only within specific browsers and assistive tools that are officially supported, limiting compatibility to a defined set of platforms and versions.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the WCAG definition of “Robust,” emphasizing compatibility with a wide range of user agents and assistive technologies over time. The other options incorrectly focus on novelty, visual richness, or limited platform support rather than long-term accessibility.',
    subject: 'Robust',
  },
  {
    id: 'q239',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'Why is compatibility with assistive technology essential?',
    options: [
      'Because assistive technologies rely on well-structured, standards-based content to accurately interpret, navigate, and present information to users.',
      'Because assistive technologies replace the need for accessible design by adapting content automatically regardless of structure or standards, compensating for any gaps in markup or semantics.',
      'Because compatibility matters only for legacy assistive tools and not for modern or future technologies, since newer tools can interpret any content format without relying on standards.',
      'Because assistive technologies work best with custom, proprietary interfaces rather than standardized content models, performing more reliably when content uses non-standard markup.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct statement reflects the BoK explanation that assistive technologies depend on semantic, standards-compliant content to function correctly. The other options incorrectly assume assistive tech can compensate for poor structure, limit compatibility to outdated tools, or favor proprietary approaches that undermine robustness.',
    subject: 'Robust',
  },
  {
    id: 'q240',
    topicId: '2c-wcag-principles',
    question: 'Who benefits from web accessibility beyond people with disabilities?',
    options: [
      'People using mobile devices, older adults, users with temporary or situational disabilities, and people with slow or unreliable internet connections all benefit from accessible web design.',
      'Only developers and accessibility specialists benefit, because accessibility mainly improves testing and maintenance workflows rather than the end-user experience.',
      'Primarily users with permanent disabilities benefit, while other users see little practical impact from accessibility improvements in their everyday browsing.',
      'Only users who rely on assistive technologies benefit, since accessibility features do not affect general usability or the experience of users without disabilities.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The correct option reflects the BoK principle that web accessibility improves usability for many groups beyond people with disabilities. The other options incorrectly limit benefits to specialists, permanent disabilities, or assistive technology users only.',
