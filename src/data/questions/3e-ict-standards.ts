    question: 'What is the overall purpose of applying accessibility standards and regulations to ICT?',

      'To regulate only government websites while excluding private digital products.',
      'To focus on usability preferences rather than legal accessibility requirements.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Applying accessibility standards and regulations to ICT establishes enforceable requirements that ensure inclusive access to digital products and services. The other options incorrectly frame accessibility as optional, limited in scope, or focused on usability rather than legal accessibility obligations.',

    question: 'What does Section 508 require of U.S. federal government websites and digital services?',
    options: [
      'It requires federal ICT to be accessible to employees and the public with disabilities by meeting Section 508 standards.',

    question: 'Does the ADA contain explicit accessibility standards for websites owned by private businesses?',
    options: [
      'No, the ADA lacks explicit web standards, but Title III still allows lawsuits over inaccessible websites and apps.',
      'Yes, the ADA defines detailed technical website standards that all private businesses must follow, specifying exact compliance benchmarks for each element of digital content and functionality.',
      'Yes, the ADA adopts WCAG directly and enforces it uniformly across all private digital services.',

    question: 'What is a key difference between U.S. and EU approaches to ICT accessibility?',
    options: [
      'The U.S. mandates accessible ICT procurement through Section 508, while the EU focuses on accessibility of released public websites and apps.',
      'The EU requires accessible procurement for all ICT purchases, while the U.S. applies accessibility only after deployment and user complaints have been received.',
      'The U.S. enforces ICT accessibility only through voluntary guidelines, while the EU relies solely on private litigation filed by individual users.',
      'Both the U.S. and EU require identical procurement-based accessibility rules for all public sector ICT systems, using the same enforcement mechanisms and technical standards.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The U.S. approach embeds accessibility into procurement via Section 508, requiring accessible ICT to be purchased. In contrast, the EU Web Accessibility Directive requires public sector websites and apps to be accessible when provided, without mandating procurement of accessible solutions.',

    options: [
      'The W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, especially WCAG 2.0 and 2.1, underpin many global ICT laws.',
      'The ISO 9001 quality management standard serves as the main basis for global ICT accessibility laws, since quality management processes are considered equivalent to accessibility requirements.',
      'National building codes primarily shape digital accessibility requirements across international jurisdictions, extending physical environment standards to cover websites and software.',
      'Industry usability heuristics replace formal technical standards in most ICT accessibility legislation, since general usability principles are considered sufficient for ensuring accessible digital products.'
