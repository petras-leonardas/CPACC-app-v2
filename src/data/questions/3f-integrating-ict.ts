    question: 'Why must ICT accessibility be integrated across the entire organization?',
    options: [
      'Because accessibility requires coordinated action across teams to ensure consistent and sustainable inclusion.',
      'Because accessibility can be handled solely by technical teams without organizational coordination.',
      'Because accessibility is only relevant during final testing and does not affect earlier workflows.',
      'Because accessibility responsibilities belong only to leadership and not operational teams.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'ICT accessibility depends on collaboration across design, development, procurement, policy, and leadership to be effective organization-wide. The other options incorrectly isolate accessibility to single roles, late stages, or narrow responsibilities rather than shared, integrated practice.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The W3C WAI supports organizations with practical guidance, educational resources, and structured approaches to embedding accessibility across policies, training, and evaluation. The other options incorrectly describe WAI as an enforcement body, a commercial vendor, or limited to code-level validation only.',

    question: 'What is the purpose of an accessibility maturity model?',
    options: [
      'It helps organizations assess current accessibility practices, identify gaps, and plan staged improvements toward sustainability.',
      'It provides a fixed accessibility score that organizations must achieve to meet compliance.',
      'It replaces the need for accessibility policies by focusing only on technical testing.',
      'It measures individual employee performance in accessibility tasks rather than organizational capabilities.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'An accessibility maturity model supports continuous improvement by helping organizations understand their current state and develop structured, long-term accessibility programs.

    topicId: '3f-integrating-ict',
    question: 'Why are management champions essential in organizational accessibility?',
    options: [
      'They secure resources, set priorities, promote accountability, and embed accessibility into organizational culture.',
      'They handle all accessibility tasks themselves to reduce the need for team-level responsibility, centralizing all duties so that other staff are not required to develop accessibility knowledge or skills.',
      'They focus mainly on legal compliance while excluding accessibility from daily workflows and routine operations.',
      'They limit accessibility efforts to short-term projects rather than long-term organizational change.',
    ],

      'It involves compliance reviews, user testing including disabled users, issue tracking, and lifecycle integration.',
      'It focuses only on automated testing tools run after products are released to the public.',
      'It relies on customer complaints rather than proactive testing or development process checks.',
      'It limits evaluation to visual design reviews without assessing functionality or usability.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Evaluating for accessibility is an ongoing, integrated process that combines technical checks, user testing, and issue management throughout development. The other options incorrectly frame evaluation as reactive, tool-only, or limited to surface-level design review.',

    question: 'How does accessibility impact recruiting and hiring practices?',
    options: [
      'Organizations must ensure accessible job postings, applications, interviews, and accommodations for equal candidate participation.',
      'Organizations may delay accessibility considerations until after a candidate with a disability is hired, treating pre-employment accessibility as optional and addressing barriers only once an employment relationship is formally established.',
      'Organizations are required to provide accommodations only after employment has officially begun, meaning that job postings, application systems, and interview processes are not subject to accessibility obligations.',
      'Organizations may restrict accessible hiring practices to government-funded recruitment programs, applying accessibility requirements selectively rather than across all recruitment activities and candidate-facing processes.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Accessibility in recruiting and hiring ensures that candidates with disabilities can participate equally throughout the hiring process. The other options incorrectly delay, limit, or narrowly scope accessibility obligations rather than treating them as integral to fair recruitment.',

    options: [
      'It ensures clear, accessible communication so staff understand accessibility requirements, roles, and commitments.',
      'It focuses on external marketing messages without addressing internal accessibility responsibilities, treating communication management as a public-facing concern rather than an organization-wide function.',

      'It relies on informal knowledge sharing instead of structured, accessible communication practices.',
    ],

    id: 'q323',
    topicId: '3f-integrating-ict',
    question: 'Why must organizations consider legal and PR implications when managing accessibility?',
    options: [
      'Because accessibility failures can cause legal penalties, reputational harm, and loss of trust, while proactive action reduces risk.',
      'Because accessibility is mainly a public relations strategy and has little connection to legal obligations.',
      'Because accessibility laws apply only after complaints arise and do not affect public reputation.',
      'Because managing accessibility is optional unless an organization is involved in government contracts.',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Accessibility failures expose organizations to lawsuits, enforcement actions, and reputational damage, while proactive accessibility demonstrates social responsibility and reduces risk.

    options: [
      'They ensure organizations purchase ICT products and services that meet accessibility standards from the start.',
      'They affect accessibility only after systems are deployed and complaints are received, treating procurement as separate from accessibility planning and requirements gathering.',
      'They apply accessibility requirements solely to low-cost tools rather than core enterprise systems, assuming that major platforms are inherently accessible.',
      'They focus on vendor pricing and performance without considering accessibility criteria, leaving compliance to be addressed after contracts are signed and products are already in use.'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Integrating accessibility into procurement embeds accessibility requirements early, preventing barriers before systems are adopted. The other options incorrectly treat accessibility as reactive, limited in scope, or unrelated to procurement decision-making.',
