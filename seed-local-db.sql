VALUES 
(101, 'Domain 1', 'Disabilities, challenges, and assistive technologies (40%)', '1A', 'Theoretical models of disability', 'Purpose of disability models', 'What is the purpose of theoretical models of disability?', 'Theoretical models of disability provide perspectives and frameworks for understanding disability, with each model offering partial insights and limitations, so organizations often draw from multiple models.', 'Theoretical models of disability determine which single, correct definition of disability should guide all accessibility practices across organizations.', 'Theoretical models of disability classify disabilities strictly by medical categories to support treatment-oriented interventions.', 'Theoretical models of disability are designed primarily to measure economic productivity impacts related to impairment.', 'The statement explaining that models offer perspectives and frameworks and that no single model is complete aligns with the BoK, which states that theoretical models "provide perspectives and frameworks to understand disability" and that organizations typically use multiple models because each has strengths and limitations . The statement claiming a single correct definition contradicts the BoK''s assertion that no model is fully correct or comprehensive. The statement describing models as strictly medical misrepresents their broader conceptual nature. The statement suggesting models are primarily economic misaligns with the BoK, which presents the economic model as only one of several theoretical approaches.'),

(102, 'Domain 1', 'Disabilities, challenges, and assistive technologies (40%)', '1A', 'Theoretical models of disability', 'Medical model', 'How does the medical model view disability?', 'The medical model views disability as an individual problem caused by disease, trauma, or other health conditions that require medical care, cure, or personal adjustment.', 'The medical model views disability as primarily the result of societal barriers that restrict participation and require environmental change.', 'The medical model views disability mainly as a cultural identity rooted in shared experiences and linguistic communities.', 'The medical model views disability as a condition defined by reduced economic productivity and eligibility for financial support.', 'The statement describing disability as an individual problem requiring medical intervention aligns with the BoK definition, which emphasizes impairment, treatment, and cure as central to the medical model . The statement attributing disability to societal barriers instead reflects the social model. The statement portraying disability as a cultural identity reflects the social identity or cultural affiliation model. The statement defining disability in economic terms aligns with the economic model, not the medical one.'),

(103, 'Domain 1', 'Disabilities, challenges, and assistive technologies (40%)', '1A', 'Theoretical models of disability', 'Medical model', 'What is a primary strength of the medical model?', 'The medical model''s strength lies in its ability to address the biological causes of disability and provide medical management or cures when appropriate.', 'The medical model''s strength is that it focuses on removing societal barriers and promoting full social inclusion.', 'The medical model''s strength is that it emphasizes disability as a valued cultural identity shared within close-knit communities.', 'The medical model''s strength is that it defines disability primarily through workplace productivity and economic outcomes.', 'The statement describing the model''s ability to address biological causes aligns with the BoK, which states that the medical model can "address the biological sources of disabilities… by clinically curing them or providing ways to medically manage conditions" . The statement focusing on removing societal barriers reflects the social model, not the medical model. The statement highlighting cultural identity aligns with the social identity or cultural affiliation model. The statement framing disability in terms of economic productivity corresponds to the economic model rather than the medical model.'),

(104, 'Domain 1', 'Disabilities, challenges, and assistive technologies (40%)', '1A', 'Theoretical models of disability', 'Medical model', 'What is a major weakness of the medical model?', 'The medical model''s weakness is that it treats disability as an individual deficit and overlooks societal and environmental barriers that contribute to disabling conditions.', 'The medical model''s weakness is that it assumes disability is solely created by society and ignores any medical or embodied aspects.', 'The medical model''s weakness is that it focuses on disability as a cultural identity and overemphasizes community belonging.', 'The medical model''s weakness is that it defines disability only in terms of economic productivity and eligibility for state benefits.', 'The statement describing the model as locating disability solely within the individual matches the BoK, which states that the medical model "treats disability as a problem or inherent characteristic of the individual" and often overlooks "unwelcoming or inaccessible environments" and broader sociopolitical constraints . The statement claiming the model assumes disability is only socially created aligns instead with the social model, not the medical model. The statement about cultural identity reflects the social identity or cultural affiliation model. The statement centering disability on economic productivity relates to the economic model, not the medical one.');
